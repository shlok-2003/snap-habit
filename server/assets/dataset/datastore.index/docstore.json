However,  as the \nspeed and ease of doing financial transactions has improved, the number of frauds reported \nin  retail  financial  transactions  have also gone  up.  Fraudsters  have  been  using  innovative \nmethods to defraud the common and gullible people of their hard-earned money, especially \nthe new entrants in the use of digital platforms who are not entirely familiar with the techno-\nfinancial eco-system. \n \nThis  booklet  has  been  compiled  from  various  incidents  of  frauds reported  as  also  from \ncomplaints  received  at  the  offices  of  RBI Ombudsmen to  provide maximum  practical \ninformation  of  value,  especially to those  who  are  inexperienced, or not so experienced, in \ndigital  and  electronic  modes  of financial  transactions.  The booklet  is intended  to  create \nawareness among the members of public about the modus operandi adopted by fraudsters to \ndefraud and mislead them, while also informing them about the precautions to be taken while \ncarrying  out  financial  transactions. It emphasizes  the  need for keeping one's  personal \ninformation, particularly the financial information, confidential at all times, be-ware of unknown \ncalls / emails / messages, practicing due diligence while performing financial transactions and \nchanging the secure credentials / passwords from time to time.

Entirely \ndepending upon overdrafts and cash creditors for meeting working capital needs may \nnot be suitable. A decision about various sources for funds should be linked to the \ncost of raising funds. If cost of raising funds is very high then such sources may not \nbe useful for long. \n   3. Selection of Source of Finance: After  preparing  a  capital  structure,  an \nappropriate source of finance is selected. Various sources, from which finance may \nbe raised, include: share capital, debentures, financial institutions, commercial banks \nloans, public deposits, etc. If finances are needed for short periods then banks, public \ndeposits and financial institutions may be appropriate; on the other hand, if long-term \nfinances are required then share capital and debentures may be useful. If the concern \ndoes not want to tie down assets as securities then public deposits may be a suitable \nsource.

This scope s related \ntot  eh  selection  of  an  investment  proposal  out  of  the  many  related  alternatives \navailable to the firm. However, the acceptance of the proposal depends on the returns \nassociated  with  that  particular  proposal.

Here, the financial manager should \ndevelop a sound dividend policy.  \nThese were some aspects and scopes of Business Finance. Though, Business Finance \ncovers a wider scope than this above are limited and important scopes of the field.  \n1.2.3 Significance of Business Finance  \n Businesses have to consider their finances for so many purposes, ranging from \nsurvival in bad times to improving the next success in good ones. How you finance \nyour  business  can  affect  your  ability  to  employ  staff,  purchase  goods,  acquire \nlicenses,  expand  and  develop.  While  finances  are  not  necessarily  as  important  as \nvision and a great product, they are crucial to making the good issue happen.  \n   1. Initial Capital: Every  new venture needs seed money. Entrepreneurs only \nhave  dreams  and  ideas  until  they  have  some  capital to  put  their  ideas  in  motion. \nWhether it's a product or service, you will need a way to create and deliver it as well \nas  enough  money  and  time  to  lay  the  groundwork  of  selling  and  establishing \nimportant relationships. Most business owners face the critical choice between debt \nand equity financing. A small business loan leaves you free to own and have absolute \ncontrol  over  your  company  while  it  also  leaves  you lasting  financial  obligations. \nEquity gives  you cash, but you have to share the success. The critical decision in \nyour financing will determine how your business will work from that point onward.  \n   2. Debt Ratios: Finances are about more than money in your hand. While most \nbusinesses have some amount of debt especially in the beginning stages too much \ndebt  compared  with  revenues  and  assets  can  leave  your  with  more  problems  than \nmaking your loan payments. Vendors and suppliers often run credit checks and may \nlimit what you can buy on credit or keep tight payment terms. Debt ratios can affect \nyour ability to attract investors including venture capital firms and to acquire or lease \ncommercial space.

Business Cycles: No matter how well your business is doing, you have to \nprepare for rainy days and even storms. Business and economic cycles bring dark \nclouds  you  can't  predict.  That's  why  smart  businesses  create  financial  plans  for \ndownturns. Cash savings, good credit, smart investments, and favorable supply and \nreal estate arrangements can help a business stay afloat or even maintain momentum \nwhen the business climate is unfavorable. \n   4. Growth: Success can bring a business to a difficult crossroads. Sometimes to \ntake  on  more  business  and  attain  greater  success,  a  company  needs  significant \nfinancial  investment  to  acquire  new  capital,  staff or  inventory.  When  business \nmanagers hit this juncture, they have to wade through their financial options, which \nmay  involve  infusions  of  equity  capitals  perhaps  from  venture  capitalists.  Every \nsituation  is  different,  but  smart  managers  consider  the  cost  of  success  and  their \noptions for obtaining growth financing. \n   5. Payroll: Nothing spells imminent death like a company being unable to make \npayroll. Even the most dedicated staff won't stick around long once the paychecks \nstop. The larger an organization gets, the larger the labor costs. Above all, companies \nhave  to  ensure  they  have  enough  cash  on  hand  to  make  payroll  for  at  least  two \npayroll cycles ahead if not more. Financial planning to ensure your payroll accounts \nare in strong shape are essential to the integrity and longevity of your company. \n1.2.4 Concept of Financial Goal \n  Every firm has a predefined goal or an objective. Therefore the most important \ngoal  of  a  financial  manager  is  to  increase  the  owner’s  economic  welfare.  Here \neconomics  welfare  may  refer  to  maximization  of  profit  or  maximization  of \nshareholders  wealth.  Therefore  Shareholders  wealth maximization  (SWM)  plays  a \nvery crucial role as far as financial goals of a firm are concerned.  \n    Profit  is  the  remuneration  paid  to  the  entrepreneur  after  deduction  of  all \nexpenses. Maximization of profit can be defined as maximizing the income of the \nfirm and minimizing the expenditure. The main responsibility of a firm is to carry out \nbusiness by manufacturing goods and services and selling them in the open market. \nThe mechanism of demand and supply in an open market determine the price of a \ncommodity or a service. A firm can only make profit if it produces a good or delivers \na service at a lower cost than what is prevailing in the market. The margin between ","metadata":{"source":"C:\\Users\\Vedant\\Documents\\Projects\\JPMC-CFG\\Team-2\\server\\assets\\dataset\\business_finance.pdf","pdf":{"version":"1.10.100","info":{"PDFFormatVersion":"1.4","IsAcroFormPresent":false,"IsXFAPresent":false,"Producer":"iLovePDF","ModDate":"D:20240615143501Z"},"metadata":null,"totalPages":344},"loc":{"pageNumber":7}}}],["25aecec1-d110-4ea8-bf16-9aa1ff347f11",{"pageContent":" \n9\nthese two prices would only increase if the firm strives to produce these goods more \nefficiently and at a lower price without compromising on the quality. \n    The demand and supply mechanism plays a very important role in determining \nthe price of a commodity. A commodity which has a greater demand commands a \nhigher  price  and  hence  may  result  in  greater  profits.  Competition  among  other \nsuppliers also effect profits. Manufacturers tend to move towards production of those \ngoods which guarantee higher profits. Hence there comes a time when equilibrium is \nreached and profits are saturated. According to Adam Smith - business man in order \nto fulfill their profit motive in turn benefits the society as well. It is seen that when a \nfirm  tends  to  increase  profit  it  eventually  makes  use  of  its  resources  in  a  more \neffective manner. Profit is regarded as a parameter to measure firm’s productivity \nand efficiency. Firms which tend to earn continuous profit eventually improvise their \nproducts according to the demand of the consumers. Bulk production due to massive \ndemand leads to economies of scale which eventually reduces the cost of production. \nLower cost of production directly impacts the profit margins. There are two ways to \nincrease the profit margin due to lower cost. Firstly a firm can produce at lower sot \nbut continue to sell at the original price, thereby increasing the revenue. Secondly a \nfirm  can  reduce  the  final  price  offered  to  the  consumer  and  increase  its  market \nthereby superseding its competitors. Both ways the firm will benefit. The second way \nwould increase its sale and market share while the first way only tend to increase its \nrevenue. Profit is an important component of any business. Without profit earning \ncapability it is very difficult to survive in the market. If a firm continues to earn large \namount  of  profits  then  only  it  can  manage  to  serve the  society  in  the  long  run. \nTherefore profit earning capacity by a firm and public motive in some way goes hand \nin  hand.  This  eventually  also  leads  to  the  growth  of  an  economy  and  increase  in \nNational Income due to increasing purchasing power of the consumer. \n1.2.5 Profit Maximization Vs Wealth maximization \n    In any company, the management is the decision taking authority. As a normal \ntendency the management may pursue its own personal goals ( Profit maximization) \nbut  in  an  organization,  where  there  is  a  significant  outside  participation \n(shareholders, lenders etc.) the management may not be able to exclusively pursue its \npersonal  goals  due  to  the  constant  supervision  of  the  various  stakeholders  of  the \ncompany-employees, creditors, customers, Government etc. ","metadata":{"source":"C:\\Users\\Vedant\\Documents\\Projects\\JPMC-CFG\\Team-2\\server\\assets\\dataset\\business_finance.pdf","pdf":{"version":"1.10.100","info":{"PDFFormatVersion":"1.4","IsAcroFormPresent":false,"IsXFAPresent":false,"Producer":"iLovePDF","ModDate":"D:20240615143501Z"},"metadata":null,"totalPages":344},"loc":{"pageNumber":8}}}],["f46b79e4-1e00-4804-ac6f-6f19676ee2cb",{"pageContent":" \n10\n    Every entity associated with the company will evaluate the performance of the \nmanagement  from  the  fulfillment  of  its  own  objective.

Profit is a long term objective, but it has a short-term perspective i.e. \none financial year. \n    Profit  can  be  calculated  by  deducting  total  cost  from  total  revenue.  Through \nprofit maximization, a firm can be able to ascertain the input-output levels, which \ngives the highest amount of profit. Therefore, the finance officer of an organisation \nshould take his decision in the direction of maximizing profit although it is not the \nonly objective of the company. \n ","metadata":{"source":"C:\\Users\\Vedant\\Documents\\Projects\\JPMC-CFG\\Team-2\\server\\assets\\dataset\\business_finance.pdf","pdf":{"version":"1.10.100","info":{"PDFFormatVersion":"1.4","IsAcroFormPresent":false,"IsXFAPresent":false,"Producer":"iLovePDF","ModDate":"D:20240615143501Z"},"metadata":null,"totalPages":344},"loc":{"pageNumber":9}}}],["dae05663-2f8f-4251-a4b6-1aa54b92af9d",{"pageContent":" \n11\nDefinition of Wealth Maximization \n    Wealth maximization is the ability of a company to increase the market value of \nits common stock over time.

The \ndetermination  of  production,  human  resource  and  marketing  strategies  are  the \nfreedom of the chief of production, purchase and marketing divisions respectively, \nbut for implementing their decisions funds are required. For example, the production \ndepartment may decide  to replace an old machine with a new one to increase the \nproduction capacity but it has financial implications too. Similarly, the purchase and \nsales  promotion  policies  are  laid  down  by  the  purchase  and  marketing  divisions \nrespectively,  but  procurement  of  materials,  advertising  and  other  sales  promotion \nactivities  cannot  be  carried  out  without  funds.  Likewise,  the  recruitment  and \npromotion  of  staff  is  the  responsibility  of  the  Human  resource  department  but \nrecruitment  and  promotion  of  employees  require  funds  for  the  payment  of  wages, \nsalaries and other benefits. Many times, it may be difficult to separate where the one \nfunction ends and other starts. It may, however be noted that although the finance of \nraising and using funds has a significant effect on other areas of management, it need \nnot limit or obstruct the general functions of the business. It is possible that a firm \nfacing financial difficulties may give more weightage to financial considerations and \ndevelop  its  own  production  and  marketing  strategies  to  suit  the  situation.  On  the \nother hand a firm with plenty of funds may not have much inflexibility with regard to \nfinancial  considerations  vis-à-vis  other  management  functions.  In  such  a  firm, \nfinancial  policies  may  be  adjusted  to  the  needs  of the  decisions  relating  to \nproduction, Human resource, marketing and other functions.  \n    Relationship  shows  balanced  behavior  of  officers  of  finance  department  and \nother department's officers. They should concentrate on one target of company and \nmany other things, they should know for creating good relation.  \nRelationship  of  finance  with  other  areas  of  management  can  be  explained  in \nfollowing way: \n   1. Relationship of Finance with Production: Production  department’s  main \nduty is to produce the goods. For producing goods, it needs raw material, labour and \nother  expenses.  For  paying  all  expenses,  production  department  needs  money  and \nfund which will be fulfilled by finance department.

With \nthis  view,  we  can  understand  that  production  department  is  dependent  on  finance \ndepartment’s  decision.  Now,  if  production  department  performs  his  duty  honestly \nand products are produced and sold on time, it will be helpful for increase sale and \nprofitability and it will again recycle the fund with high profit in finance department. \nSo, we can say both are dependent on each other. Both are players of business team. \nBoth should be adopt co-operative view for each other. After this, business team can \nsucceed in business.  \n   2. Relationship of Finance with Marketing: Marketing  department’s  main \nduty is to sell maximum goods and satisfy the consumers. Its product’s input cost \nwill decrease if all products are sold by marketers of company. For developing the \nproduct,  promotion  activities  and  distribution  activities  of  marketing  department \nneed  some  money  for  paying  salesmen,  advertising  budget  and  other  promotional \nexpenses.  For  this  marketing  department  makes  his  marketing  budget  and  it  is \ncleared by finance department, but sometime finance department will not all specific \nmarketing  expenses  but  marketing  department  need  that  type  of  expenses  for \npromotion of sales. This will create confliction. Good relations will be helpful for \nboth  departments.  If  both  department  does  meeting  and  show  behavior  like  good \nrelative, the problem can easily solve. Both departments should think that both are \nthe  part  of  company’s  organization  and  co-ordination  between  them  is  must. \nSometime, marketing department obtains big order for supplying the goods, at that \ntime  finance  department  should  help  marketing  department  for  arrangement  of \nmoney for buying raw material and supplying quickly without any delay.  \n   3. Relationship of Finance with Personnel: Personnel are that science which \nmanages the employees of company and finance is that science which manages the \nmoney.  If  personnel  department  and  finance  department  work  together  with  co-\noperation, both departments can satisfy the objectives of company. It is the objective \nof company to satisfy employee by fulfilling their financial needs. It is also objective \nof company to reduce the misuse of fund by paying excess salary that required cost \nof  doing  work  by  employee.  So,  both  department  should  understand  each  other’s \nobjective and should help other department for fulfilling the objectives.

Management is heavily dependent on accounting for \noperating facts. Accounting' has been described by Richard M. Lynch and Robert W. \nWilliamson  as  \"the  measurement  and  communication  of  financial  and  economical \ndata.  In  fact,  accounting  information  relates  to  the  production,  sales,  expenses, \ninvestments, losses and gains of the business. Accounting has three branches namely, \nfinancial accounting, cost accounting and management accounting.  \n   4. Financial Accounting: It is concerned with the preparation of reports which \nprovide  information  to  users  outside  the  firm.  The most  common  reports  are  the \nfinancial  statements  included  in  the  annual  reports  of  stock-holders  and  potential \ninvestors. The main objective of these-reports is to inform stockholders, creditors and \nother  investors  how  assets  are  controlled  by  a  firm.  In  the  light  of  the  financial \nstatements  and  certain  other  information,  the  accountant  prepares  funds  film \nstatement,  cash  flow  statement  and  budgets.  A  master  plan  (Budget)  of  the \norganization  includes  and  coordinates  the  plans  of every  department  in  financial \nterms.  According  to  Guthmann  and  Dougall,  “Problems  of  finance  are  intimately \nconnect ed while problems of purchasing, production and marketing”.  \n   5. Cost Accounting:  It  deals  primarily  with  cost  data.  It  is  the  process  of \nclassifying,  recording,  allocating  and  reporting  the  various  costs  incurred  in  the \noperation of an enterprise. It includes a detailed system of control for material, labour \nand overheads. Budgetary control and standard casting are integral part of Primary \nDisciplines.  The  purpose  of  cost  accounting  is  to  provide  information  to  the \nmanagement for decision making, planning and control. It facilitates cost reduction \nand cost control. It involves reporting of cost data to the management. \n   6. Management Accounting:  It  refers  to  accounting  for  the  management.  It \nprovides necessary information to assist the management in the creation of policy \nand  in  the  day  to  day  operations.  It  enables  the  management  to  discharge  all  its \nfunctions,  namely,  planning,  organizing,  staffing, direction  and  control  efficiently \nwith  the  help  of  accounting  information.  Functions of  management  accounting \ninclude  all  activities  connected  with  collecting,  processing,  interpreting  and \npresenting  information  to  the  management.  According  to  J.

Such  movements  are  usually the  concern  of  senior \nadministrators, who must use financial forecasting to explain a long-term plan for the \nfirm. Shorter-term resources are then devised to meet the plan’s intentions. When a \ncompany plans to develop, it may rely on cash reserves, expected progress in sales, \nor bank loans and trade credits prolonged by suppliers. Managers may also decide to \nraise long-term capital in the form of either debt (bonds) or equity (stock). \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFunctions of Business finance \nShort term \ninvestment \nLong term \ninvestment \nManagerial Functions \nRoutine Functions \nInvestment \ndecision  \nFinancing \ndecision  \nFund \nCollection \nReserve \nmaintenance \nInformation  \ncollection \nPreparing \nfinancial \nstatements ","metadata":{"source":"C:\\Users\\Vedant\\Documents\\Projects\\JPMC-CFG\\Team-2\\server\\assets\\dataset\\business_finance.pdf","pdf":{"version":"1.10.100","info":{"PDFFormatVersion":"1.4","IsAcroFormPresent":false,"IsXFAPresent":false,"Producer":"iLovePDF","ModDate":"D:20240615143501Z"},"metadata":null,"totalPages":344},"loc":{"pageNumber":16}}}],["66c92300-1b35-4cab-b38a-6a469b89856b",{"pageContent":" \n18\nA) Managerial functions: \n   a. Investment decision: Investment decisions relate to the selection of assets in \nwhich funds will be invested by a firm. Funds procured from different sources have \nto be invested in various kinds of assets. The investment of funds is used in a project \nfor various fixed assets and also for current assets.  The investment of funds in a \nproject has to be made after careful assessment of the various projects through capital \nbudgeting. A part of long term funds is also to be kept for financing the working \ncapital  requirements.  Asset  management  policies  are  to  be  laid  down  regarding \nvarious items of current assets. The inventory  policy  would be determined by the \nproduction  manager  and  the  finance  manager  keeping in  view  the  requirement  of \nproduction  and  the  future  price  estimates  of  raw  materials  and  the  availability  of \nfunds. One of the most important finance functions is to intelligently allocate capital \nto long term assets. This activity is also known as capital budgeting. It is important to \nallocate capital in those long term assets so as to get maximum yield in future. \na.  Following  are  the  two  aspects  of  investment  decision  Evaluation  of  new \ninvestment in terms of profitability  \nb.

This  risk  factor  plays  a  very  significant  role  in  calculating  the \nexpected  return  of  the  prospective  investment.  Therefore  while  considering \ninvestment proposal it is important to take into consideration both expected return \nand the risk involved. \n    Investment decision not only involves allocating capital to long term assets but \nalso  involves  decisions  of  using  funds  which  are  obtained  by  selling  those  assets \nwhich become less profitable and less productive.

Technological change: In modem times, one often finds fast obsolescence of \ntechnology. New technology, which is relatively more efficient, takes the place of \nold technology; the latter getting downgraded to some less important applications. \nHowever, in taking a decision of this type, the management has to consider the cost \nof new equipment vis-à-vis the productive efficiencies of the new as well as the old \nequipments. However, while evaluating the cost of new equipment, the management \nshould  not  take  into,  account  its  full  accounting  cost  (as  the  equipment  lasts  for \nyears) but its incremental cost. Also, the cost of new equipment is often partly offset \nby the salvage value of the replaced equipment. \n   2. Competitors 'strategy: Many a time an investment is taken to maintain the \ncompetitive strength of the firm; If the competitors are installing new equipment to \nexpand output or to improve quality of their products, the firm under consideration \nwill have no alternative but to follow suit, else it will perish. It is, therefore, often \nfound  that  the  competitors'  strategy  regarding  capital  investment  plays  a  very \nsignificant role in forcing capital decisions on a firm.  \n   3.  Demand  forecast:  The  long  -run  forecast  of  demand  is  one  of  the \ndeterminants of investment decision. If it is found that there is a market potential for \nthe product in the long run, the dynamic firm will have to take decisions for capital \nexpansion.  \n   4. Type of management: Whether capital investment would be encouraged or \nnot  depends,  to  a  large  extent,  on  the  viewpoint  of  the  management.  If  the \nmanagement  is  modern  and  progressive  in  its  outlook,  the  innovations  will  be \nencouraged, whereas a conservative management discourages innovation and fresh \ninvestments.  \n   5 Fiscal policies: Various tax policies of the government (like tax concessions \non investment income, rebate on new investment, method of allowing depreciation ","metadata":{"source":"C:\\Users\\Vedant\\Documents\\Projects\\JPMC-CFG\\Team-2\\server\\assets\\dataset\\business_finance.pdf","pdf":{"version":"1.10.100","info":{"PDFFormatVersion":"1.4","IsAcroFormPresent":false,"IsXFAPresent":false,"Producer":"iLovePDF","ModDate":"D:20240615143501Z"},"metadata":null,"totalPages":344},"loc":{"pageNumber":18}}}],["7ac57eb5-bf86-471b-aafe-816b3b305152",{"pageContent":" \n20\ndeduction  allowance)  also  have  favourable  or  unfavourable  influence  on  capital \ninvestment. \n   6. Cash flows:  Every  firm  makes  a  cash  flow  budget.  Its  analysis influences \ncapital investment decisions. With its help the firm plans the funds for acquiring the \ncapital  asset.  The  budget  also  shows  the  timing  of availability  of  cash  flows  for \nalternative  investment  proposals,  thereby  helping  the  management  in  selecting  the \ndesired project. \n   7. Return expected from the investment:  In  most  of  the  cases,  investment \ndecisions  are  made  in  anticipation  of  increased  return  in  future.  While  evaluating \ninvestment proposals, it is therefore essential for the firm to estimate future returns or \nbenefits accruing from the investment. \nC)   Finance decision:  \n These  decisions  relate  to  acquiring  the  optimum  finance  to  meet  financial \nobjectives and seeing that fixed and working capital are effectively managed. The \nfinancial  manager  needs  to  possess  a  good  knowledge  of  the  sources  of  available \nfunds and their respective costs and needs to ensure that the company has a sound \ncapital structure. i.e. clear understanding as to the difference between profit and cash \nflow,  bearing  in  mind  that  profit  is  the  little  avail  unless  the  organisation  is \nadequately supported by cash to pay for assets and sustain the working capital cycle. \nFinancing  decisions  also  call  for  a  good  knowledge of  evaluation  of  risk  e.g. \nexcessive debt carried high risk for an organization’s equity because of the priority \nrights of the lenders. A major area for risk related decisions is in overseas trading. \nWhere an organisation is vulnerable to currency fluctuations, and the manager must \nbe well aware of the various protective procedures such as hedging- it is a strategy \ndesigned to minimize, reduce or cancel out the risk in another investment available to \nhim. For example, someone who has a shop takes care of the risk of the goods being \ndestroyed by fire by hedging it via a fire insurance contract. \n    Financial decision is important function which a financial manger must perform. \nIt is important to make wise decisions about when, where and how should a business \nacquire  funds.  Funds  can  be  acquired  through  many  ways  and  channels.  Broadly \nspeaking  a  correct  ratio  of  an  equity  and  debt  has to  be  maintained.  This  mix  of \nequity capital and debt is known as a firm’s capital structure.

On the other hand the \nuse of debt affects the risk and return of a shareholder. It is more risky though it may \nincrease  the  return  on  equity  funds.  A  sound  financial  structure  is  said  to  be  one \nwhich aims at maximizing shareholders return with minimum risk. In such a scenario \nthe market value of the firm will maximize and hence an optimum capital structure \nwould be achieved. Other than equity and debt there are several other tools which are \nused in deciding a firm capital structure. \nAccording  to  Henry  Hoagland,  The  Financial  decision  affects  both  the \nprofitability and risk of a firm’s operation.  An increase in cash holdings, for instance \nrisk, but, because of cash is not an earning asset, converting other types of assets to \ncash reduces the other firm’s profitability.  Similarly, the issue of additional debt can \nraise the profitability of a firm, but more debt means more risk. Striking a balance \nbetween  risk  and  profitability  that  will  maintain  the  long  term  value  of  a  firm’s \nsecurities in the large of finance.  \nD)   Dividend decision:  \n These decisions relate to the determination as to how much and how frequently \ncash  can  be  paid  out  of  the  profits  of  an  organization  as  income  for  its \nowners/shareholders. The owner of any profit making organization looks for reward \nfor his investment in two ways, the growth of the capital invested and the cash paid \nout as income for a sole trader this income would be termed as drawings and for a \nlimited liability company the term is dividends. The dividend decision thus has two \nelements- the amount to be paid out and the amount to be retained to support the \ngrowth of the organisation, the latter being also a financing decision, the level and \nregular  growth  of  dividends  represent  a  significant  factor  in  determining  a  profit \nmaking  company’s  market  value,  i.e.  the  value  placed  on  its  shares  by  the  stock \nmarket. Earning profit or a positive return is a common aim of all the businesses. But \nthe  key  function  a  financial  manger  performs  in  case  of  profitability  is  to  decide \nwhether  to  distribute  all  the  profits  to  the  shareholder  or  retain  all  the  profits  or \ndistribute  part  of  the  profits  to  the  shareholder  and  retain  the  other  half  in  the \nbusiness.  It’s the financial manager’s responsibility to decide a optimum dividend \npolicy which maximizes the market value of the firm. Hence an optimum dividend \npayout ratio is calculated. It is a common practice to pay regular dividends in case of \nprofitability  another  way  is  to  issue  bonus  shares to  existing  shareholders.  The \nfinancial manager must take careful decisions on how the profit should be distributed ","metadata":{"source":"C:\\Users\\Vedant\\Documents\\Projects\\JPMC-CFG\\Team-2\\server\\assets\\dataset\\business_finance.pdf","pdf":{"version":"1.10.100","info":{"PDFFormatVersion":"1.4","IsAcroFormPresent":false,"IsXFAPresent":false,"Producer":"iLovePDF","ModDate":"D:20240615143501Z"},"metadata":null,"totalPages":344},"loc":{"pageNumber":20}}}],["066b8378-a6ad-4ed7-8ccc-4c93b2f7ce0b",{"pageContent":" \n22\namong shareholders. It is very important and crucial part of the business concern, \nbecause these decisions are directly related with the value of the business concern \nand shareholder’s wealth. Like financing decision and investment decision, dividend \ndecision is also a major part of the financial manager. When the business concerns \ndecide  dividend  policy,  they  have  to  consider  certain  factors  such  as  retained \nearnings and the nature of shareholder of the business concern. \nFactors which influence dividend decisions \n   1. Legal constraints: Normally all countries prohibit companies from paying \nout as cash dividends any portion of the firm’s legal capital, which is measured by \nthe par value of equity shares (common stock) Other countries define legal capital to \ninclude not only the par value of the equity shares (common stock), but also premium \npaid  if  any  (any-paid  in–capital  in  excess  of  par).  These  capital  impairment \nrestrictions  are  generally  established  to  provide  a  sufficient  equity  base  to  protect \ncreditor’s claims. An earnings requirement limiting the amount of dividends to the \nsum of the firm’s present and past earnings is sometimes imposed. In other words the \nfirm cannot pay more in cash dividends than the sum of its most recent and past-\nretained earnings. However, the firm is not prohibited from paying more in dividends \nthan its current earnings. Thus dividends can be paid only out of the profits earned \nduring  a  financial  year  after  providing  for  depreciation  and  after  transferring  to \nreserves  such  percentage  of  profits  as  prescribed  by  law.  Due  to  inadequacy  or \nabsence of profits in any year, dividend may be paid out of the accumulated profits \nof  the  previous  years.  Dividends  cannot  be  declared  for  past  years  for  which  the \naccounts have been closed. \n   2. Contractual constraints: Often, the firm’s ability to pay cash dividends is \nconstrained by restrictive provisions in a loan agreement. Generally, these constraints \nprohibit the payment of cash dividends until a certain level of earnings have been \nachieved,  or  they  may  limit  dividends  to  a  certain amount  or  a  percentage  of \nearnings. Constraints on dividends help to protect creditors from losses due to the \nfirm’s insolvency. The violation of a contractual constraint is generally grounds for a \ndemand of immediate payment by the funds supplier. \n   3. Internal constraints: The firm’s ability to pay cash dividends is generally \nconstrained by the amount of excess cash available rather than the level of retained \nearnings against which to charge them. Although it is possible for a firm to borrow ","metadata":{"source":"C:\\Users\\Vedant\\Documents\\Projects\\JPMC-CFG\\Team-2\\server\\assets\\dataset\\business_finance.pdf","pdf":{"version":"1.10.100","info":{"PDFFormatVersion":"1.4","IsAcroFormPresent":false,"IsXFAPresent":false,"Producer":"iLovePDF","ModDate":"D:20240615143501Z"},"metadata":null,"totalPages":344},"loc":{"pageNumber":21}}}],["0fea3a11-901c-44b0-9320-5d8d67cf002f",{"pageContent":" \n23\nfunds to pay dividends, lenders are generally reluctant to make such loans because \nthey produce no tangible or operating benefits that will help the firm repay the loan. \nAlthough  the  firm  may  have  high  earnings,  its  ability  to  pay  dividends  may  be \nconstrained by a low level of liquid assets. (Cash and marketable securities) \n   4. Growth prospects: The firm’s financial requirements are directly related to \nthe anticipated degree of asset expansion. If the firm is in a growth stage, it may need \nall its funds to finance capital expenditures. Firms exhibiting little or no growth may \nnever need replace or renew assets. A growth firm is likely to have to depend heavily \non internal financing through retained earnings instead of distributing current income \nas dividends \n   5. Owner considerations: In establishing a dividend policy, the firm’s primary \nconcern  normally  would  be  to  maximize  shareholder’s  wealth.  One  such \nconsideration is then tax status of a firm’s owners. Suppose that if a firm has a large \npercentage of wealthy shareholders who are in a high tax bracket, it may decide to \npay out a lower percentage of its earnings to allow the owners to delay the payments \nof  taxes  until  they  sell  the  stock.  Of  course,  when  the  equity  share  is  sold,  the \nproceeds are in excess of the original purchase price, the capital gain will be taxed, \npossible at a more favorable rate than the one applied to ordinary income. Lower-\nincome shareholders, however who need dividend income will prefer a higher payout \nof earnings. As of now, the dividend income is not taxed in the hands of the share \nholders  in  India.  Instead,  for  paying  out  such  dividends  to  its  share  holders,  the \ncompany bears the dividend distribution tax. \n   6. Market Considerations: The risk-return concept also applies to the firm’s \ndividend policy. A firm where the dividends fluctuate from period to period will be \nviewed as risky, and investors will require a high rate of return, which will increase \nthe firm’s cost of capital. So, the firm’s dividend policy also depends on the market’s \nprobable response to certain types of policies. Shareholders are believed to value a \nfixed  or  increasing  level  of  dividends  as  opposed  to  a  fluctuating  pattern  of \ndividends. In other words, the market consideration is a kind of information content \nof the dividends. It’s a kind of signal for the firm to decide its final policy. A stable \nand continuous dividend is a positive signal that conveys to the owners that the firm \nis in good in health. On the other side, if the firm skips in paying dividend due to any \nreason, the shareholders are likely to interpret this as a negative signal.

Taxation: the firm’s earnings are taxable in many countries. This taxation is \napplied differently in different countries.  \nE)   Liquidity decision:  \n It is very important to maintain a liquidity position of a firm to avoid insolvency. \nFirm’s  profitability,  liquidity  and  risk  all  are  associated  with  the  investment  in \ncurrent assets. In order to maintain a tradeoff between profitability and liquidity it is \nimportant to invest sufficient funds in current assets. But since current assets do not \nearn  anything  for  business  therefore  a  proper  calculation  must  be  done  before \ninvesting in current assets. Current assets should properly be valued and disposed of \nfrom time to time once they become non profitable. Currents assets must be used in \ntimes of liquidity problems and times of insolvency. \nF)   Routine Functions:  \n Routine function is also called incidental function. Some other functions are also \naccomplished by financial managers. These are commonly known as routine works:  \n• Fund collection \n• Reserve maintenance \n• Information collection \n• Preparing financial statements, etc. \n1.2.8 Concept of capitalization  \n    Capitalization is one of the most important parts of financial decision, which is \nrelated  to  the  total  amount  of  capital  employed  in the  business  concern. \nUnderstanding the concept of capitalization leads to solve many problems in the field \nof  financial  management.

S. Dewing \n    “Capitalization is the sum total of the par value of all shares”. \n1.2.9 Theories of capitalization \n    The problems of determining the amount of capitalization is necessary both for a \nnewly  started  company  as  well  as  for  an  established  concern.  In  case  of  the  new \nenterprise, the problem is more severe in so far as it requires the reasonable provision \nfor future as well as for current needs and there arises the danger of either raising \nexcessive or insufficient capital. But the case is different with established concerns. \n    They  have  to  revise  or  modify  their  financial  plan  either  by  issuing  of  fresh \nsecurities or by reducing the capital and making it in conformity with the needs of \nthe enterprises. However, to estimate the amount of capitalization two theories have \nbeen pronounced. \n1.   The cost theory of capitalization: \n    Under this theory, the capitalization of a company is determined by adding the \ninitial actual expenses to be incurred in setting up a business enterprise as a going \nconcern.  It  is  aggregate  of  the  cost  of  fixed  assets  (plant,  machinery,  building, \nfurniture, goodwill, and the like), the amount of working capital (investments, cash, \ninventories,  receivables)  required  to  run  the  business,  and  the  cost  of  promoting, \norganizing and establishing the business. \n    In other works, the original total outlay incurred on various items becomes the \nbasis  for  determining  the  capitalization  of  a  company.  If  the  funds  raised  are \nsufficient to meet the initial costs and day to day expenses, the company is said to be \nadequately  capitalized.  This  theory  is  very  helpful  for  the  new  companies  as  it \nfacilitates the calculation of the amount of funds to be raised initially. \n    Cost  theory,  no  doubt,  gives  a  concrete  idea  to  determine  the  magnitude  of \ncapitalization,  but  it  fails  to  provide  the  basis  for  assessing  the  net  worth  of  the ","metadata":{"source":"C:\\Users\\Vedant\\Documents\\Projects\\JPMC-CFG\\Team-2\\server\\assets\\dataset\\business_finance.pdf","pdf":{"version":"1.10.100","info":{"PDFFormatVersion":"1.4","IsAcroFormPresent":false,"IsXFAPresent":false,"Producer":"iLovePDF","ModDate":"D:20240615143501Z"},"metadata":null,"totalPages":344},"loc":{"pageNumber":24}}}],["32426b4f-cdca-4fb5-8ec1-753b856d7a27",{"pageContent":" \n26\nbusiness  in  real  terms.  The  capitalization  determined  under  this  theory  does  not \nchange with earnings. \n    Moreover, it does not take into account the future needs of the business. This \ntheory is not applicable to the existing concerns because it does not suggest whether \nthe  capital  invested  justifies  the  earnings  or  not.  Moreover,  the  cost  estimates  are \nmade at a particular period of time. They do not take into account the price level \nchanges. For example, if some of the assets may be purchased at inflated prices, and \nsome assets may remain idle or may not be fully utilized, earnings will be low and \nthe company will not be able to pay a fair return on the capital invested. The result \nwill be over-capitalization. In order to do away with these difficulties and arrive at a \ncorrect figure of capitalization, ‘earnings approach’ is used. \n2.   The earnings theory of capitalization: \n    This theory assumes that an enterprise is expected to make profit. According to \nit, its true value depends upon the company’s earnings and/or earning capacity. Thus, \nthe capitalization of the company or its value is equal to the capitalized value of its \nestimated  earnings.  To  find  out  this  value,  a  company,  while  estimating  its  initial \ncapital  needs,  has  to  prepare  a  projected  profit  and  loss  account  to  complete  the \npicture of earnings or to make a sales forecast. \n    Having  arrived  at  the  estimated  earnings  figures, the  financial  manager  will \ncompare  with  the  actual  earnings  of  other  companies  of  similar  size  and  business \nwith necessary adjustments. \n    After  this  the  rate  at  which  other  companies  in  the  same  industry,  similarly \nsituated are making earnings on their capital will be studied. This rate is then applied \nto the company’s estimated earnings for determining its capitalization. \n    Under the earnings theory of capitalization, two factors are generally taken into \naccount to determine capitalization (i) how much the business is capable of earning \nand (ii) What is the fair rate of return for capital invested in the enterprise. This rate \nof  return  is  also  known  as  ‘multiplier’  which  is  100  per  cent  divided  by  the \nappropriate rate of return. \n    Thus, if a company is capable of making net profit of Rs. 30,000 annually and \nthe rate of earnings is 10%, the capitalization of the company will be 3,00,000 (i.e. \n30,000 x 100/ 10). But if the total investment during that period in the whole industry ","metadata":{"source":"C:\\Users\\Vedant\\Documents\\Projects\\JPMC-CFG\\Team-2\\server\\assets\\dataset\\business_finance.pdf","pdf":{"version":"1.10.100","info":{"PDFFormatVersion":"1.4","IsAcroFormPresent":false,"IsXFAPresent":false,"Producer":"iLovePDF","ModDate":"D:20240615143501Z"},"metadata":null,"totalPages":344},"loc":{"pageNumber":25}}}],["9ce09b41-ebc4-4801-bd39-a82d918ddd07",{"pageContent":" \n27\nis ten crores of rupees and the total earnings of the industry rate Rs. 1.5 crores, the \nearning capacity of the industry are thus 15%. \n    But business under consideration is earning 10% only. This is a case of over \ncapitalization as the earnings of Rs. 30,000 justify investment of Rs. 2,00,000 only \nRs.  30,000  X  100/15)  in  view  of  earning  capacity  of  the  industry.  Hence,  the \ncompany is over- capitalized to the tune of  Rs. 1, 00,000. Though earning theory is \nmore  appropriate  for  going  concerns,  it  is  difficult  to  calculate  the  amount  of \ncapitalization  under  this  theory.  It  is  based  upon a  ‘rate’  by  which  earnings  are \ncapitalized. This rate is difficult to estimate in so far as it is determined by a number \nof factors not capable of being calculated quantitatively. \n    These factors include nature of industry/ financial risks, competition prevailing \nin the industry and so on. New companies cannot depend upon this theory as it is \ndifficult to estimate the expected returns in their case. \n    As  regards  capitalization,  it  is  often  said  that  “a  concern  should  neither  be \novercapitalized,  nor  under-capitalized,  the  aim  should  be  to  achieve  fair \ncapitalization”. To understand the significance of this statement, let us first look into \nthe technicalities of over and under capitalization. \n1.2.10 Over capitalization \n It is a situation where a firm has more capital than it needs. Assets are worth less \nthan  its  issued  share  capital,  and  earnings  are  insufficient  to  pay  dividend  and \ninterest.  This  situation  mainly  arises  when  the  existing  capital  is  not  effectively \nutilized on account of fall in earning capacity of the company while company has \nraised funds more than its requirements. The chief sign of overcapitalization is the \nfall in payment of dividend and interest leading to fall in value of the shares of the \ncompany.  \nConcept of overcapitalization  \n    Over capitalization refers to the company which possesses an excess of capital \nin relation to its activity level and requirements. In simple means, over capitalization \nis more capital than actually required and the funds are not properly used.  \n    According to Bonneville, Dewey and Kelly, over capitalization means, “When a \nbusiness is unable to earn fair rate on its outstanding securities”.

This  company  will  be  said  to  be  properly  capitalized.  Suppose  the  capital \ninvestment of the company is Rs. 60,000, it will be over capitalization to the extent \nof  Rs.  1,00,000.  The  new  rate  of  earning  would  be: 50,000/60,000×100=8.33% \nWhen the company has over capitalization, the rate of earnings will be reduced from \n10% to 8.33%.  \n    According to Gerstenberg, “A company is over-capitalized when its earnings \nare not large enough to yield a fair return on the amount of stock and bonds \nthat have been issued, or when the amount of securities outstanding exceeds the \ncurrent value of the assets”. Simply stated, over-capitalization means more capital \nthan  actually  required,  and  therefore,  in  a  over  capitalized  concern,  the  invested \nfunds are not properly used. It is, therefore, quite clear that over-capitalization may \nbe explained in terms of earnings as well as cost of assets. \nSymptoms of overcapitalization \n    Generally,  an  entity  is  said  to  be  overcapitalized  when  it  has  fixed  assets  in \nexcess  of  its  actual  needs  and  a  reasonable  return is  not  being  earned  on  the \ninvestments  of  these  fixed  assets.  Sometimes,  we  might  consider  an  entity \novercapitalize when it has substantial amounts of intangibles represented by inflated \nvalues  like  in  the  case  of  patents,  trademark,  good  will  and  other  deferred  assets. \nHence  instead  of  looking  at  the  shareholder  funds  alone,  there  is  a  need  for  the \ndeduction  of  these  intangibles  assets  from  the  shareholder  fund  to  get  the  real \ntangible worth of the entity. \n1.

Over-issue of capital: while floating a new company, the promoters over-\nestimate the financial requirements, and as a result, they raise more capital than what \nis actually needed, resulting in over-capitalization.  \n   2. Promotion, formation or development during inflation: If a company is to \nbe floated during an inflationary period, or any development activity is carried out in \nsuch a period, it will be a victim of over-capitalization because it has to spend huge \namounts.  \n   3. Buying assets of lower value at higher prices: It promoters buy assets of \nlower  values  at  higher  prices;  they  are  led  to  a  situation  of  over-capitalization \nbecause assets of lower value will be shown at higher value in the Balance sheet. \n   4. High Promotion expenses: Incurring high promotional expenses, excessive \npreliminary expenses etc. may lead to over-capitalization.  \n   5. Inadequate depreciation: Providing inadequate depreciation results in over-\ncapitalization as it leaves insufficient provision for replacement of assets.  \n   6. Liberal dividend policy: Many companies prefer to declare a higher rate of \ndividend  instead  of  retaining  a  part  of  the  profits  and  ploughing  them  back  or \nreinvesting  them.  Such  a  practice  should  be  discouraged  as  it  leads  to  over-\ncapitalization, because liberal dividends are paid at the cost of inadequate provision \nfor depreciation.  \n   7. Taxation Policy: High rates of taxation may leave little in the hands of the \nmanagement  to  provide  for  depreciation,  replacements  and  dividends.  This  will \nadversely affect earnings capacity and thus leads to over-capitalization.  \n   8.  Inadequate  demand  for  products: If  a  company’s  products  register  a \nconstant decline, it will bring down the profitability of the concern and as a result, \nreturns on capital employed will be reduced which represents over-capitalization.  \n   9. Payment of high rate of interest:  Procurement  of  funds  at  high  rate  of \ninterest will adversely affect the company resulting in over-capitalization.  \n   10.

The  evil \neffects of over-capitalization are discussed below: \nA.   Effects on the Company:  \n    The effects of over-capitalization on the company itself are disastrous in many \nways:  \n   (i) Loss of goodwill: In an over-capitalized company, there is a reduced earning \ncapacity resulting in the fall of market price of its shares and thereby shaking up the \ninvestor’s confidence. A company whose shares sell below the face value may find it \ndifficult to improve its goodwill in the market.  \n   (ii) Poor creditworthiness:  Reduced  earnings  of  an  over-capitalized  concern \naffect its creditworthiness and as a result, it becomes difficult for it to get loans or \ncredit at cheaper rates of interest.  \n   (iii) Difficulties in obtaining capital: For a company faced with a situation of \nover-capitalization,  it  is  very  difficult  to  obtain  further  capital  for  its  growth  and \nexpansion programmes. It is so because the investors have already lost confidence in \nthe  company. (iv) Decline in efficiency of the company:  To  cover  for  one  loss, \nother losses are incurred by the company and in the process overall efficiency of the \ncompany declines. Such a company usually does not make adequate provisions for \ndepreciation, repairs and renewals, etc., leading to further decline in its efficiency. \n   (v)  Loss  of  market:  Over-Capitalized  companies  fail  to  produce  goods  at \ncompetitive costs and, hence, often lose their market to competitors. \n   (vi) Inflated profits:  In order to regain the confidence of its investors, over-\ncapitalized  companies  generally  resort  to  manipulation  of  accounts  and  over-\nstatement of their profits. These inflated profits lead to payments of dividends out of \ncapital.  \n (vii)  Liquidation  of  company.  An  over-capitalized  company  goes  into \nliquidation unless drastic steps are taken to re-organize the whole capital structure \nand re-organisation would itself lead to a lot of problems. \n \n ","metadata":{"source":"C:\\Users\\Vedant\\Documents\\Projects\\JPMC-CFG\\Team-2\\server\\assets\\dataset\\business_finance.pdf","pdf":{"version":"1.10.100","info":{"PDFFormatVersion":"1.4","IsAcroFormPresent":false,"IsXFAPresent":false,"Producer":"iLovePDF","ModDate":"D:20240615143501Z"},"metadata":null,"totalPages":344},"loc":{"pageNumber":29}}}],["2d2f9731-5f05-400e-b7cf-bbe34c55732a",{"pageContent":" \n31\nB.   Effects on Shareholders:  \n As, shareholders are the real owners of a company, they suffer most on account \nof  over-capitalization.  Some  of  the  major  effects  of  over-capitalization  on \nshareholders are:  \n   (i) Reduced dividends: An over-capitalized company will not be able to pay a \nfair  rate  of  dividend  to  its  shareholders  because  it  is  earning  a  low  rate  of  return \n(earnings) on its capital. More so, the payment of dividend becomes uncertain and \nirregular.  \n    (ii) Fall in the value of shares: Low rate of earnings and reduced dividends \ncause  fall  in  the  market  value  of  shares  of  the  over-capitalized  company.  Thus, \nshareholders have to suffer a loss in capital due to depreciation of their investments.  \n   (iii) Unacceptable as collateral security:  The  shares  of  an  over-capitalized \ncompany  have  small  value  as  collateral  security.  Banks  and  other  financial \ninstitutions  are  reluctant  to  lend  money  against  such  securities.  Hence,  it  is  very \ndifficult for the shareholders to borrow money against the security of their shares. \n   (iv)  Loss  on  speculation:  the  prices  of  the  shares  of  an  over-capitalized \ncompany  remain  unstable  because  of  speculative  dealings  in  such  shares.  This \nmalpractice further adds to the losses of the shareholders.  \n   (v) Loss on re-organisation: An over-capitalized company has to often resort to \norganization and reduction of its capital in order to write off the accumulated losses. \nThis results in the reduction of face value of shares and loss to its owners. \nC. Effects on Society:  \n Over-capitalization  affects  not  only  the  company  and  its  owners  but  also  the \nsociety as a whole. \n   (i) Loss to Consumers: In order to prevent declining trend of income, an over-\ncapitalized  concern  resorts  to  increased  prices  and  reduction  in  quality  of  its \nproducts.. Hence, consumers have to suffer by paying more for the poorer quality. \n   (ii) Loss to Workers: An over-capitalized company tends to reduce wages and \nwelfare facilities of the workers to reduce losses of the earnings. No consideration is \ngiven to the demands of the workers and some of them even lose their jobs because \nof lay offs and retrenchment and closure of such units.

Hence, the scarce resources of society are \nnot properly utilized.  \n   (iv)  Gambling  in  Shares: Another  social  evil  of  over-capitalization  is \npromotion of gambling habits by providing scope for gambling in shares of such a \ncompany. \n   (v) Recession: Over-capitalization  leads  to  increased  losses,  poor  quality  of \nproducts,  retrenchment  or  unemployment  of  workers, decline  in  wage  rates  and \npurchasing power of labour. This tendency gradually affects the entire industry and \nthe society, and may lead to recession of economy. \n   Remedies for Over-Capitalization: The evil effects of over-capitalization are \nso grave that the management must take remedial measures to rectify the situation as \nsoon as the first symptoms of over-capitalization are observed by the firm. An over-\ncapitalized company has been rightly compared with a very fat person who is likely \nto  suffer  from  various  diseases  unless  he  takes  steps  to  immediately  reduce  his \nweight.  Likewise,  an  over-capitalized  company  must cut  its  dead  weight  before  it \nbecomes  deep  rooted  and  almost  impossible  to  get  rid  of.  In  this  regard,  various \nremedial  measures  such  as  increasing  the  efficiency  of  management,  reduction  of \nhigh interest bearing funded debt, redemption of preference shares, reduction in face \nvalue and number of shares, etc., have been suggested. \n   1. To have Efficient Management: Management should try to become more \nefficient and try to curb excess expenditure. Earning capacity should be improved \nand  care  must  be  taken  to  spend  every  single  rupee in  the  most  profitable  and \neconomic manner.  \n   2. Redemption of Preference Shares: Preference shares carrying high rate of \ndividend should be redeemed out of retained earnings in order to raise the share of \nequity shareholders.  \n   3. Reduction of Funded Debts: Debentures, public deposits and loans taken at \nhigher rates of interest should be prepaid out of accumulated profits or out of fresh \nborrowings at lower rates of interest, if there are no accumulated profits.  \n   4. Reorganization of Equity Share Capital: The face value or the number of \nequity  shares  may  be  reduced  in  order  to  rectify  over-capitalization.

The amount available due to reorganization of share capital \nis utilized for writing off the fictitious assets and other over-valued assets.  \n1.2.11 Under capitalization:  \n    Under  capitalization  is  the  opposite  concept  of  over  capitalization  and  it  will \noccur when the company’s actual capitalization is lower than the capitalization as \nwarranted by its earning capacity. Under capitalization is not the so called inadequate \ncapital.  It  is  a  state,  when  its  actual  capitalization  is  lower  than  its  proper \ncapitalization as warranted by its earning capacity. This situation normally happens \nwith companies which have insufficient capital but large secret reserves in the form \nof  considerable  appreciation  in  the  values  of  the  fixed  assets  not  brought  into  the \nbooks.  \nConcept of undercapitalization  \n    According to Gersrtenberg, “A company may be under-capitalized when the \nrate of profits it is making on the total capital is exceptionally high in relation to \nthe return enjoyed by similarly situated companies in the same industry, or \nwhen it has too little capital with which to conduct its business”.  \n    Hoagland defined under capitalization as “an excess of true assets value over the \naggregate of stocks and bonds outstanding”.  \n    In simple words, we can say that under-capitalization is the reverse phenomenon \nof over-capitalization, and occurs when a company’s actual capitalization is lower \nthan its proper capitalization as warranted by its earning capacity. The term under-\ncapitalization should never be considered synonymous with inadequate capital. The \nreal value of an under-capitalized company is more than its book value. The profits \nare higher than warranted by the book value of its assets. Such a company can pay a \nhigher rate of dividend and the market value of its shares is much higher than its face \nvalue. \nSymptoms of undercapitalization \n    The assets acquired with the existing capitalization facilitate the generation of \nhigher profits. It so happens when: (i) The assets have been acquired at lower rates, \nor (ii).

The symptoms of under-capitalization are as \nfollows:  \n1. There is an unforeseen increase in earnings of the company.  \n2. Future earnings of the company were under-estimated at the time of promotion. \n3. Assets might have been acquired at very low prices. \nCauses of undercapitalization \nFollowing are the important causes of under-capitalization in a company:  \n   1.  Under-Estimation  of  Capital  Requirements: If  the  future  capital \nrequirements  are  underestimated  by  the  promoters,  the  inadequacy  of  capital  is \nexperienced at a later stage. The company may arrange cheaper debt at lower rate of \ninterest  at  that  stage  resulting  in  increased  earnings  per  share.  This  leads  the \ncompany to a situation of under-capitalization. \n   2. Under-Estimation of Future Earnings: While preparing the financial plan, \nif the future earnings of the company are under estimated and the actual earnings turn \nout to be higher than the estimated figure, the company may find itself in a condition \nof under-capitalization.  \n   3. Promotion during Depression: Companies  promoted  during  a  period  of \ndepression often experience under-capitalization when inflation sets in because of a \nsudden rise in their earnings. \n   4. Conservative Dividend Policy: If the management of a particular company \nadopts an orthodox dividend policy, i.e. where it follows a cautious policy regarding \nthe distribution of dividend and keeps a major part of its earnings for re-investment \npurpose, it results into higher earnings and conditions of under-capitalization.  \n   5. Very Efficient Management: In companies, where the management is very \nefficient, the rate of return may be quite high as compared to other companies in the \nsame industry, and such a high rate of return may eventually lead towards under-\ncapitalization.  \n   6.  Desire  of  Control  and  Trading  on  Equity: In  many  companies,  the \npromoter desires to retain control over the company and raises lesser amount of share \ncapital.

This  raising  of  funds  at  a  lower  rate  of  interest  than  the  earnings  of  the \ncompany eventually leads to under-capitalization. \nEffects of undercapitalization: under capitalization have the following effects: \n   1. Limited marketability of shares: share of undercapitalized company enjoy \nmarket value but it limits marketability. It may cause large fluctuations in the market. \nDue  to  limited  marketability,  such  company’s  shares  may  not  command  a  price \nwhich commensurate with the increase in its earnings. \n   2. Industrial unrest: employees know the company has tremendous profits and \nit is not allotted with them, it may encourage industrial unrest. But company cannot \nsatisfy the financial demands of the employees. These demands continue to grow day \nby day. \n   3. Consumer dissatisfaction: consumer always aware of the significant profits \nof a company.  They also feel that company is exploiting them by earning higher \nprofits. Hence, they expect from a company to lower the price or improve the quality \nof  product.  When  a  company  cannot  satisfy  consumer’s  expectations,  it  leads  to \nconsumer dissatisfaction. \n   4. Government interference:  the  government  always  keeps  watch  on  profit \nmaking companies. It often suspects that company may be concealing their profits \nwith  a  view  to  evading  tax.  High  earning  per  share may  attract  government \ninterference to bring down the prices of the product so as to protect the interest of \nconsumer and other stakeholders. \n   5. Inadequacy of capital: undercapitalized company suffers from inadequacy \nof capital and a company depends on borrowing on debts at higher rate of interest.

Issue of Bonus Shares: The Company may issue bonus shares by capitalizing \nits accumulated earnings. This is the most commonly used and effective method of \ncorrecting under-capitalization. It reduces earnings per share after the bonus issue. \n   3. Increasing the Par Value of Shares: The Company may revalue its assets \nand  increase  their  values.

Capital \nstructure means the arrangement of capital from different sources so that the long-\nterm  funds  needed  for  the  business  are  raised.  Capital  structure  refers  to  the \nproportions  or  combinations  of  equity  share  capital,  preference  share  capital, \ndebentures, long-term loans, retained earnings and other long-term sources of funds \nin the total amount of capital which a firm should raise to run its business. Decisions \nrelating  to  financing  the  assets  of  a  firm  are  very  crucial  in  every  business.  The \nfinance manager is regularly fixed in the difficulty of what the optimum proportion \nof debt and equity. As a general rule, there should be a proper mix of debt and equity \ncapital in financing the firm’s assets. Capital structure is usually considered to serve \nthe interest of the equity shareholders.  \n    The relative proportion of various sources of funds used in a business is termed \nas financial structure. Capital structure is a part of the financial structure and refers to \nthe proportion of the various long-term sources  of financing.  It is  concerned with \nmaking  the  selection  of  the  sources  of  the  funds  in  a  proper  manner,  which  is  in \nrelative degree and proportion. The capital structure of a company is made up of debt \nand equity securities that include a firm’s financing of its assets. It is the permanent \nfinancing of a firm represented by long-term debt, preferred stock and net worth. It \nrelates to the arrangement of capital and excludes short-term borrowings. It denotes \nsome degree of permanency as it excludes short-term sources of financing. Again, \neach  component  of  capital  structure  has  a  different  cost  to  the  firm.  In  case  of \ncompanies, it is financed from various sources. In proprietary concerns, usually, the \ncapital employed, is entirely contributed by its owners. In this context, capital refers \nto the total of funds supplied by both owners and long-term creditors. What should \nbe  the  appropriate  proportion  between  owned  and  debt  capital?  It  depends  on  the \nfinancial policy of individual firms. In one company debt capital may be zero while \nin another such capital may even be greater than the owned capital. The proportion \nbetween the two, usually expressed in terms of a ratio, denotes the capital structure \nof a company. \n    In short, Capital structure refers to the percentage of capital (money) at work in \na business by type. There are two forms of capital: equity capital and debt capital.

Gerestenberg,  ‘Capital structure of a company refers to the composition or \nmake  up  of  its  capitalization  and  it  includes  all  long  term  capital  resources  viz., \nloans, reserves, shares and bonds’.  \n    2. Keown  et  al.  defined  capital  structure  as,  ‘balancing  the  array  of  funds \nsources in a proper manner, i.e. in relative magnitude or in proportions’. \n    3.  P.  Chandra,  ‘capital  structure  is  essentially  concerned  with how  the  firm \ndecides to divide its cash flows into two broad components, a fixed component that is \nearmarked to meet the obligations toward debt capital and a residual component that \nbelongs to equity shareholders’. \n    4.  John  J.  Hampton Capital structure is the combination of debt  and equity \nsecurities that comprise a firm’s financing of its assets.” \n    5.  I.  M.  Pandey  “Capital  structure  refers  to  the  mix  of  long-term sources  of \nfunds, such as, debentures, long-term debts, preference share capital and equity share \ncapital including reserves and surplus.” \n    Capital structure is the mix of the long-term sources of funds used by a firm. It \nis made up of debt and equity securities and refers to permanent financing of a firm. \nIt is composed of long-term debt, preference share capital and shareholders’ funds. \nHence, capital structure implies the composition of funds raised from various sources \nbroadly classified as debt and equity. It may be defined as the proportion of debt and \nequity in the total capital that will remain invested in a business over a long period of \ntime. Capital structure is concerned with the quantitative aspect. A decision about the \nproportion among these types of securities refers to the capital structure decision of \nan enterprise.  \n    The term capital structure should not be confused with financial structure and \nAssets structure. While financial structure consists of short-term debt, long-term debt \nand share holders’ fund i.e., the entire left hand side of the company’s Balance Sheet. \nBut capital structure consists of long-term debt and shareholders’ fund. The capital \nstructure  of  a  firm  is  a  part  of  its  financial  structure.  Some  experts  of  financial \nmanagement include short-term debt in the composition of capital structure. In that \ncase, there is no difference between the two terms—capital structure and financial \nstructure.  So,  capital  structure  is  different  from financial  structure.

Capital structure refers to the proportion of long-term debt and \nequity in the total capital of a company. On the other hand, financial structure refers \nto the net worth or owners’ equity and all liabilities (long-term as well as short-term). \nCapital  structure  does  not  include  short-term  liabilities  but  financial  structure \nincludes short-term liabilities or current liabilities.  \n    Capital Structure is referred to as the ratio of different kinds of securities raised \nby a firm as long-term finance. The capital structure involves two decisions-  \na. Type of securities to be issued is equity shares, preference shares and long term \nborrowings (Debentures). \nb. Relative ratio of securities can be determined by process of capital gearing. On \nthis basis, the companies are divided into two- \ni)   Highly  geared  companies - Those companies whose proportion of equity \ncapitalization is small. \nii)  Low geared companies - Those companies whose equity capital dominates \ntotal capitalization. \n    For instance - There are two companies A and B.

It is clear \nthat a business should be at least able of earning enough revenue to meet its cost of \ncapital  and  finance  its  growth.  Hence,  along  with  a  risk  as  principle  the  finance \nmanager  has  to  consider  the  cost  aspect  carefully  while  determining  the  capital \nstructure. According to this principle, an ideal pattern of capital structure is one that \nminimizes cost of capital structure and maximizes earnings per share. For example, \nDebt capital is cheaper than equity capital from the point of its cost and interest being \ndeductible  for  income  tax  purpose,  whereas  no  such deduction  is  allowed  for \ndividends.  \n    B) Risk Principle: The finance manager attempts to plan the capital structure in \nsuch  a  manner,  that  risk  and  cost  are  the  least  and  the  control  of  the  existing \nmanagement is diluted to the least extent. However, there are also additional factors \nalso like marketability of the issue and flexibility of the capital structure, timing of \nraising  the  funds.    According  to  this  principle,  reliance  is  to  be  found  more  on \ncommon equity for financing capital requirements than excessive use of debt. Use of \nmore  and  more  debt  means  higher  commitment  in  form of  interest  payout.  This \nwould lead to erosion of shareholders value in unfavourable business situation. There \nare two risks associated with this principle: \n     (i) Business  Risk:  it  is  an  unavoidable  risk  because  of  the  environment  in  \nwhich the firm has to operate and it is represented by the variability of earning before \ninterest  and  tax.  The  variability  in  turn  is  influenced  by  revenues  and  expenses. \nRevenues and expenses are affected by demand of  firm products, variations in prices \nand proportion of fixed cost I in total  cost. \n     (ii)  Financial risk: it is a risk associated with the availability of earnings per \nshare  caused  by  use  of  financial  leverage.  It  is  the  additional  risk  borne  by  the \nshareholders when a firm uses debt in addition to equity financing.  Financial risk \nalso two types:  \na. Risk of cash insolvency- as a firm raises more debt, its commitment towards \ndebt service increases. This is due to two reasons. Firstly, higher the debt, the \ngreater  the  amount  of  interest  payable,  even  in  years  o  insufficient  profit. \nSecondly,  the  principal  has  to  be  repaid  in  committed  installments,  even  if \nsufficient cash is not available. Thus the risk of cash insolvency increases.  ","metadata":{"source":"C:\\Users\\Vedant\\Documents\\Projects\\JPMC-CFG\\Team-2\\server\\assets\\dataset\\business_finance.pdf","pdf":{"version":"1.10.100","info":{"PDFFormatVersion":"1.4","IsAcroFormPresent":false,"IsXFAPresent":false,"Producer":"iLovePDF","ModDate":"D:20240615143501Z"},"metadata":null,"totalPages":344},"loc":{"pageNumber":47}}}],["e9607aae-984d-48bc-948b-42eb5e259b00",{"pageContent":" \n49\nb.  Risk  of  variation  in  the  EPS-  Equity  shareholders  are  entitled  to  residual \nearnings only, i.e. earning after meeting interest, tax and preference dividend. \nHence,  as  interest  increases,  these  will  be  lower  probability  that  equity \nshareholders will enjoy a stable dividend. As a result of financial leverage, if \ndebt content is high in the capital structure, the risk of variations in expected \nearnings available to equity shareholders will be higher.         \n    Generally, a firm should neither be exposed to high degree of business risk and \nlow degree of financial risk or vice-versa, so that shareholders do not bear a higher \nrisk. \nC)   Control Principle:  \n    Along  with  cost  and  risk  principles,  the  control  principle  is  also  important \nconsideration in planning the capital structure. When a company issues further equity \nshares, automatically dilutes the controlling interest of the present owners. Similarly, \npreference shareholders can have voting rights and thereby affect the composition of \nthe  Board  of  Directors,  in  case  dividends  on  such  shares  are  not  paid  for  two \nconsecutive years. Financial institutions normally require that they shall have one or \nmore directors on the Boards. Hence, when the  management agrees to raise loans \nfrom financial institutions by implication it agrees to sacrifice a part of its control \nover  the  company.  It  is  noticeable,  therefore,  that  decision  concerning  capital \nstructure are taken after keeping the control factor in mind. \n    While designing a capital structure, the finance manager may also keep in mind \nthe present management control and ownership remains uninterrupted. Issue of new \nequity will reduce existing control pattern and also it involves higher cost. Issue of \nmore debt causes no reduction in control, but causes a higher degree of financial risk. \nThe consideration of retaining control of the business is an important factor in capital \nstructure  decisions.  If  the  existing  equity  shareholders  do  not  like  to  reduce  the \ncontrol,  they  may  prefer  debt  capital  to  equity  capital,  as  previous  has  no  voting \nrights. \n    There  are  three  major  considerations  in  capital  structure  are  Risk,  Cost  and \nControl. These are differing for various components of capital i.e. own  funds and \nloan funds a comparative analysis is given as under: \n ","metadata":{"source":"C:\\Users\\Vedant\\Documents\\Projects\\JPMC-CFG\\Team-2\\server\\assets\\dataset\\business_finance.pdf","pdf":{"version":"1.10.100","info":{"PDFFormatVersion":"1.4","IsAcroFormPresent":false,"IsXFAPresent":false,"Producer":"iLovePDF","ModDate":"D:20240615143501Z"},"metadata":null,"totalPages":344},"loc":{"pageNumber":48}}}],["9c1b400d-2f38-4764-a89b-ce7c14756520",{"pageContent":" \n50\nComparative Analysis \nTypes of \nfund \nRisk Cost Control \nEquity \nCapital \nLow risk- no question \nof repayment of capital  \nexpect when the \ncompany is under \nliquidation- hence best \nfrom viewpoint of risk \nMost expensive-\ndividend \nexpectations of \nshareholders are \nhigher than interest \nrats also dividends \nare not tax \ndeductible \nDilution of control-\nsince the capital \nbase might be \nexpanded and new \nshareholders/public \nare involved \nPreference \ncapital \nSlightly higher risk \nwhen compared to \nEquity capital principal \nis redeemable after a \ncertain period even if \ndividend payment is \nbased on profits \nSlightly cheaper \ncost than Equity but \nhigher than interest \nrate on loan funds. \nFurther, preference \ndividends are not \ntax-deductible  \nNo dilution of \ncontrol since voting \nrights are restricted \nLoan funds \nHigh risk-capital \nshould be repaid as per \nagreement interest \nshould be paid \nirrespective of \nperformance or profits \nComparatively \nCheaper- prevailing \ninterest rates are \nconsidered only to \nthe extent of after \ntax impact \nNo dilution of \ncontrol-but some \nfinancial institutions \nmay insist on \nnomination of their \nrepresentatives in \nthe board of \ndirectors \nD)   Flexibility Principle:  \n    Flexibility it means that the management chooses such a combination of sources \nof financing which it finds easier to adjust according to changes in need of funds in \nfuture.

Flexibility provides opportunity for expansion, both in terms of lower \nimpact on cost and with no significant rise in risk profile.  \n    In  an  enterprise,  the  capital  structure  should  be such  that  there  are  both \ncontractions  as well as  relaxation in plans. Debentures and loans  can be refunded \nback as the time requires. While equity capital cannot be refunded at any point it \nprovides  inflexibility  to  plans.  Therefore,  in  order  to  make  the  capital  structure \npossible, the company should go for issue of debentures and other loans. \nE)   Timing Principle:  \n Proper timing of a security issue often brings sustainable savings because of the \ndynamic nature of the capital market. Hence, the issue should be made at the right \ntime so as to minimize effective cost of capital. The management should constantly \nstudy the trend in the capital market and time its issue carefully. \n    Besides,  above  principles,  other  factors  such  as  nature  of  industry  and \ncompetition  in  the  industry  should  also  be  considered.  Industries  facing  severe \ncompetition also resort to more equity than debt. \n    Thus, a finance manager in designing a suitable pattern of capital structure must \nput  forward  about  satisfactory  compromise  between  the  above  principles.  The \ncompromise  can  be  reached  by  assigning  weights  to  these  principles  in  terms  of \nvarious characteristics of the company. \n2.2.3 Factors influencing the capital structure \n    There  are  various  factors  influencing  on  capital  structure.  These  factors  are \nmostly depending on types of business and situation of economy of the country. The \nfollowing factors influence the capital structure decisions: \n    1. Risk of cash insolvency: Risk of cash insolvency arises due to failure to pay \nfixed interest liabilities. Generally, the higher proportion of debt in capital structure \ncompels the company to pay higher rate of interest on debt irrespective of the fact \nthat the fund is available or not. The non-payment of interest charges and principal \namount in time will call for liquidation of the company. The sudden withdrawal of \ndebt  funds  from  the  company  can  cause  cash  insolvency.  This  risk  factor  has  an \nimportant bearing in determining the capital structure of a company and it can be \navoided if the project is financed by issues equity share capital.

Risk  in  variation  of  earnings: The  higher  the  debt  content  in  the  capital \nstructure  of  a  company,  the  higher  will  be  the  risk  of  variation  in  the  expected \nearnings  available  to  equity  shareholders.  If  return  on  investment  on  total  capital \nemployed (i.e., shareholders’ fund plus long-term debt) exceeds the interest rate, the \nshareholders get a higher return. \n    On the other hand, if interest rate exceeds return on investment, the shareholders \nmay not get any return at all. \n    3.  Cost  of  capital: Cost  of  capital  means  cost  of  raising  the  capital  from \ndifferent  sources  of  funds.  It  is  the  price  paid  for  using  the  capital.  A  business \nenterprise should generate enough revenue to meet its cost of capital and finance its \nfuture growth. The finance manager should consider the cost of each source of fund \nwhile  designing  the  capital  structure  of  a  company.  Many  of  the  most  successful \ncompanies in the world decide their capital structure on one simple consideration — \nthe cost of capital. If you can borrow money at 7 percent for 30 years in a world of 3 \npercent inflation and reinvest it in core operations at 15 percent, you would be wise \nto consider at least 40 percent to 50 percent in debt capital in your overall capital \nstructure particularly if your sales and cost structure are relatively stable. \n    4.  Trading  on  equity: The  word  “equity”  denotes  the  ownership  of  the \ncompany. Trading on equity means the taking advantage of equity share capital to \nborrowed  funds  on  reasonable  basis.  It  refers  to  additional  profits  that  equity \nshareholders  earn  because  of  issuance  of  debentures  and  preference  shares.  It  is \nbased on the thought that if the rate of dividend on preference capital and the rate of \ninterest on borrowed capital is lower than the general rate of company’s earnings, \nequity  shareholders  are  at  advantage  which  means  a company  should  go  for  a \njudicious blend of preference shares, equity shares as well as debentures. Trading on \nequity becomes more important when expectations of shareholders are high. \n    The use of fixed interest bearing securities along with owner’s equity as sources \nof finance is known as trading on equity. It is an arrangement by which the company \naims at increasing the return on equity shares by the use of fixed interest bearing \nsecurities (i.e., debenture, preference shares etc.). \n    If  the  existing  capital  structure  of  the  company  consists  mainly  of  the  equity \nshares, the return on equity shares can be increased by using borrowed capital.

If  the  rate  of  return  on  total  capital  employed  exceeds  the  rate  of \ninterest on debt capital or rate of dividend on preference share capital, the company \nis said to be trading on equity. \n    6.  Government  policies: Capital  structure  is  influenced  by  Government \npolicies, rules and regulations of SEBI and lending policies of financial institutions \nwhich  change  the  financial  pattern  of  the  company  totally.  Monetary  and  fiscal \npolicies of the Government will also affect the capital structure decisions. Raising \nfinance  by  way  of  borrowing  or  issue  of  equity  is  subject  to  policies  of  the \nGovernment and its r regulatory bodies like RBI etc. The various policies and rules, \nregulations stipulated from time to time by these bodies have to be complied with for \nacquiring funds through the particular mode.  \n    7. Size of the company: Availability of funds is greatly influenced by the size \nof company. A small company finds it difficult to raise debt capital. The terms of \ndebentures  and  long-term  loans  are  less  favourable to  such  enterprises.  Small \ncompanies have to depend more on the equity shares and retained earnings. On the \nother hand, large companies issue various types of securities despite the fact that they \npay less interest because investors consider large companies less risky. Small size \nbusiness firm’s capital structure generally consists of loans from banks and retained \nprofits. While on the other hand, big companies having  goodwill, stability and an \nestablished profit can easily go for issuance of shares and debentures as well as loans \nand  borrowings  from  financial  institutions.  The  bigger  the  size,  the  wider  is  total \ncapitalization. \n    8.  Needs  of  the  investors: While  deciding  capital  structure  the  financial \nconditions  and  psychology  of  different  types  of  investors  will  have  to  be  kept  in \nmind. For example, a poor or middle class investor may only be able to invest in \nequity  or  preference  shares  which  are  usually  of  small  denominations,  only  a \nfinancially  sound  investor  can  afford  to  invest  in debentures  of  higher \ndenominations. A cautious investor who wants his capital to grow will prefer equity \nshares.  Different  types  of  securities  are  issued  to  different  classes  of  investors \naccording to their requirements, sometimes; the investor may be motivated by the ","metadata":{"source":"C:\\Users\\Vedant\\Documents\\Projects\\JPMC-CFG\\Team-2\\server\\assets\\dataset\\business_finance.pdf","pdf":{"version":"1.10.100","info":{"PDFFormatVersion":"1.4","IsAcroFormPresent":false,"IsXFAPresent":false,"Producer":"iLovePDF","ModDate":"D:20240615143501Z"},"metadata":null,"totalPages":344},"loc":{"pageNumber":52}}}],["ac6bb6c9-d183-41fb-b857-1a5227c09983",{"pageContent":" \n54\noptions and advantages available with a security e.g. double options, convertibility, \nsecurity of principal and interest etc. \n    9. Period of finance: The period for which finance is needed also influences the \ncapital structure. When long-term funds (say 10 years) are needed, it should be raised \nby  issuing  debentures  or  preference  shares.  But  if the  funds  are  for  permanent \nrequirement, it will be appropriate to raise them by the issue of equity shares. for \nMedium term it should be raise by debt.  \n    10.  Nature  of  business: It  has  great  influence  in  the  capital  structure  of the \nbusiness,  companies  having  stable  and  certain  earnings  prefer  debentures  or \npreference  shares  and  companies  having  no  assured  income  depends  on  internal \nresources. Enterprises which enjoy stable earnings and dividend with a proven track \nrecord may go for borrowings or preference shares, since they are having adequate \nprofits  to  pay  interest/  fixed  charges.  But  companies,  which  do  not  have  assured \nincome, should preferably rely on internal resources to a large extent since; it may be \ndifficult to attract investors towards the issue.  \n    11. Purpose of financing: Capital structure of a company is also affected by the \npurpose  of  financing.  Funds  are  required  for  long  term  productive  purposes  like \nmanufacturing; setting up new plant etc. may be procure through issue of long- term \nsources.  But,  the  funds  are  required  for  non-Productive  purposes  like  welfare \nfacilities to employees, such as school, hospital etc. internal sources of financing may \nhave to be procured. \n    12.  Corporate  taxation: Interest  on  borrowed  capital  is  a  tax-  deductible \nexpense. But, dividend is not. Also the cost of raising finance through borrowing is \ndeductible  in  the  year  in  which  it  is  incurred. If  it  is  incurred  during  the  pre-\ncommencement period, it is to be capitalized. Due to the tax saving advantage, debt \nhas a cheaper effective cost than preference shares or equity shares. The impact of \ntaxation should be carefully analyzed.  When corporate income is subject to taxes, \ndebt financing is favourable. This is so because the dividend payable on equity share \ncapital  and  preference  share  capital  are  not  deductible  for  tax  purposes,  whereas \ninterest paid on debt is deductible from income and reduces a firm’s tax liabilities. \nThe  tax  saving  on  interest  charges  reduces  the  cost  of  debt  funds.  Moreover,  a \ncompany  has  to  pay  tax  on  the  amount  distributed  as  dividend  to  the  equity \nshareholders.  Due  to  this,  total  earnings  available  for  both  debt  holders  and ","metadata":{"source":"C:\\Users\\Vedant\\Documents\\Projects\\JPMC-CFG\\Team-2\\server\\assets\\dataset\\business_finance.pdf","pdf":{"version":"1.10.100","info":{"PDFFormatVersion":"1.4","IsAcroFormPresent":false,"IsXFAPresent":false,"Producer":"iLovePDF","ModDate":"D:20240615143501Z"},"metadata":null,"totalPages":344},"loc":{"pageNumber":53}}}],["a480d836-0629-4f24-b4ea-c779db113b79",{"pageContent":" \n55\nstockholders are more when debt capital is used in capital structure. Therefore, if the \ncorporate tax rate is high enough, it is prudent to raise capital by issuing debentures \nor taking long-term loans from financial institutions. \n    13.  Cash  inflows: The  selection  of  capital  structure  is  also  affected  by  the \ncapacity of the business to generate cash inflows. It analyses solvency position and \nthe ability of the company to meet its charges. \n    14. Provision for future: The provision for future requirement of capital is also \nto be considered while planning the capital structure of a company. Future growth \nconsiderations and further requirements of capital should also be considered \n    15. EBIT-EPS analysis: In accounting and finance, earnings before interest and \ntaxes (EBIT), is a measure of a firm's profit that includes all expenses except interest \nand  income  tax  expenses.  It  is  the  difference  between  operating  revenues  and \noperating expenses. If the level of EBIT is low from HPS point of view, equity is \npreferable to debt.  If the EBIT is high from EPS point of view, debt financing is \npreferable to equity. If ROI is less than the interest on debt, debt financing decreases \nROE. When the ROI is more than the interest on debt, debt financing increases ROE. \n2.2.4 Trading on Equity \n    Trading  on  equity  means  to  raise  fixed  cost  capital  (borrowed  capital  and \npreference share capital) on the basis of equity share capital so as to increasing the \nincome  of  equity  shareholders.  Trading  on  equity  occurs  when  a  corporation  uses \nbonds, other debt, and preferred stock to increase its earnings on common stock. The \nterm trading on equity means debts are contracted and loans are raised mainly on the \nbasis of equity capital. Those who provide debt have a limited share in the firm’s \nearning and hence want to be protected in terms of earning and values represented by \nequity capital. Since fixed charges do not vary  with firms earnings before interest \nand tax a magnified effect is produced on earning per share. Whether the leverage is \nfavourable, in the sense, increase in earnings per share more proportionately to the \nincreased earnings before interest and tax, depends on the profitability of investment \nproposal.  If the rate of  returns on investment  exceeds their explicit cost, financial \nleverage is said to be positive. In a company, it is the directors who are so called \nelected representatives of equity shareholders. These members have got maximum \nvoting rights in a concern as compared to the preference shareholders and debenture \nholders. Preference shareholders have reasonably less voting rights while debenture ","metadata":{"source":"C:\\Users\\Vedant\\Documents\\Projects\\JPMC-CFG\\Team-2\\server\\assets\\dataset\\business_finance.pdf","pdf":{"version":"1.10.100","info":{"PDFFormatVersion":"1.4","IsAcroFormPresent":false,"IsXFAPresent":false,"Producer":"iLovePDF","ModDate":"D:20240615143501Z"},"metadata":null,"totalPages":344},"loc":{"pageNumber":54}}}],["9d6e5cfc-eeae-430a-a42d-3f90f296490d",{"pageContent":" \n56\nholders have no voting rights. If the company’s management policies are such that \nthey want to retain their voting rights in their hands, the capital structure consists of \ndebenture holders and loans rather than equity shares. \n    Trading on Equity, also known as financial leverage is the balance between the \ncost  financing  operations  with  equity  or  debt  and  the  income  earned  from  the \noperations. In other words, it’s a gamble. The company is betting that the return from \nthe investment will  generate more income than it costs to finance the investment. \nTrading on the equity occurs using both equity and debt. \nExample \n    First  let’s  look  at  an  equity  example.  The  board  of  directors  can  issue  more \npreferred shares to pay for its expansions or operations. In this case, management is \nbetting  that  the  new  expansions  will  generate  more income  for  the  common \nshareholders than the newly issued preferred shares will require in annual dividend \npayments. \n    Companies also finance much of their operations and expansions using debt in \nthe form of bonds or loans. In this case, management is usually convinced that it will \nbe able to generate more profits from the new expanded assets than the interest and \nprinciple payments required by the new liabilities. \n    Depending  on  the  company  issuing  preferred  shares is  more  profitable  than \ntaking on more debt. This is because many investors who think common stock is too \nrisky are interested in the benefits of preferred shares. With equity investors, there \nare  no  interest  obligations  and  depending  on  the  class  of  shares  being  issued \ndividends  doesn’t  have  to  be  paid  annually.  This  allows  the  company  to  gain  the \ncapital it needs to expand without immediate cash outlays for interest. It also gives \nthe company time to make a profit with the new assets. \n    As  you  can  see,  Trading  on  Equity  is  a  type  of  trade  off.  The  firm  uses  its \nfinancing of debt or equity to purchase new assets. In turn, it uses its new assets to \npay for or finance its debt and equity obligations. \nEffects of Trading on Equity:  \n    Trading on equity acts like as a lever to enlarge the influence of fluctuations in \nearnings.

The cost of \ncapital is largely an academic term which is useful for measuring the efficiency of \nmanagement  in  decision  making  of  rising  of  funds  through  the  above  mentioned \nsources  of  finance.  It  is  an  important  concept  in  formulating  a  firm’s  capital \nstructure. Each source has the cost i.e. dividend and interest and that particular cost is \nknown as cost of capital. \nMeaning of WACC- \n    A firm’s Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC) represents its blended cost \nof  capital across  all  sources,  including  common  shares,  preferred  shares,  and \ndebt.  The cost of each type of capital is weighted by its percentage of total capital \nand they are added together. A firm’s total cost of capital is a weighted average of \nthe  cost  of  equity  and  the  cost  of  debt,  known  as  the  Weighted  Average  Cost  of \nCapital. The Weighted Average Cost of Capital shows us the relationship between the \ncomponents of capital, commonly Equity and Debt. Debt and equity capital are used \nto  fund  a  business’s  operations,  capital  expenditure, acquisitions,  and  other \ninvestments. There are tradeoffs firms have to make when they decide whether to use \ndebt or equity to finance operations, and managers will balance the two to find the \noptimal capital structure. In short Capital Structure is the Mix of Debt Capital (Long \nTerm Liability) and Equity Capital Equity Capital, Reserve and Surplus, Profit and \nLoss Account less fictitious Assets. \nImportance of Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC)  \n    WACC  has  the  purpose  of  determining  the  cost  of  each  component  of  the \nstructure of capital. Each element has its associated cost: \n    Ordinary shares pay out dividends; \n    The firm pays interest on its debt; \n    Preferred stock has a fixed rate payment. \n    The  WACC  is  an  essential  part  of  the  Discounted  Cash  Flow  (DCF) model, \nwhich  makes  it  a  vital  concept,  especially  for  finance  professionals  in  business \ndevelopment and investment banking.

It represents the minimum return a company must earn on its asset base to \nsatisfy its owners, creditors, and other capital providers, or they will invest elsewhere. \n    A company can have multiple sources of capital, like common stock, preferred \nstock,  regular  debt,  convertible  debt,  options,  pension  liabilities,  government \nsubsidies, and others. Different securities represent different sources of financing and \nare expected to generate separate returns. Therefore the Weighted Average Cost of \nCapital considers the weights of all sources of financing. However, the more complex \nthe capital structure of a company is, the harder it gets to calculate its WACC. \nOptimal capital structure \n    The optimal capital structure of a firm is often defined as the proportion of debt \nand equity that results in the lowest weighted average cost of capital (WACC) for the \nfirm.

No trading on \nequity: When the company raises capital only with the help of equity, the company \ncannot take the advantage of trading on equity. \n    5.  Ownership  Dilution:  new  equity  shares  may  dilute  the  ownership  and \ncontrol of the existing shareholders.

Certain  restrictions  on  the  option  provide  a \nfinancial incentive for employees to align their  goals with those of the company's \nshareholders. ESOP’s  are  Employee  Stock  Option  Plans  under  which  employees \nreceive  the  right  to  purchase  a  certain  number  of  shares  in  the  company  at  a \npredetermined price, as a reward for their performance and also as motivation for \nemployees to keep increasing their performance. Employees typically have to wait \nfor a certain duration known as vesting period before they can to purchase the shares. \nThe main aim of giving such a plan exercise the right to its employees is to give \nshares of the company to its employees at a discounted price to the market price at \nthe  time  of  exercise.  Many  companies  (especially  in  the  startup  phase)  have  now \nstarted giving Employee Stock Options as this is beneficial to both the employer as \nwell as the employee. \nBenefits of ESOP’s \n    The major benefits of awarding Employee Stock Options are mentioned below: \nLock-in Period: \n    ESOP’s come with a lock6in period known as vesting period and employees can \nexercise the options only after this period. If the employee leaves the organisation \nbefore completing the specified period – these ESOP’s get lapsed and the employee \nwill not get any benefit. \n ","metadata":{"source":"C:\\Users\\Vedant\\Documents\\Projects\\JPMC-CFG\\Team-2\\server\\assets\\dataset\\business_finance.pdf","pdf":{"version":"1.10.100","info":{"PDFFormatVersion":"1.4","IsAcroFormPresent":false,"IsXFAPresent":false,"Producer":"iLovePDF","ModDate":"D:20240615143501Z"},"metadata":null,"totalPages":344},"loc":{"pageNumber":82}}}],["8b1e0d41-41d0-47f3-b9f8-e9052061239f",{"pageContent":" \n84\nA ‘Sense of Ownership’ for the employees: \n    When the employees are given shares of the same company in which they are \nworking, it gives them a sense of feeling that now they are not employees of this \norganisation but are the owners. As they are now they owners, they also have a share \nin  the  profits  of  the  company.  In  fact,  since  employees  directly  benefit  from  the \nincrease in the share price, they focus on overall value creation for the company. \nKind instead of Cash \n    ESOP’s are a way of awarding the employees in kind instead of cash. In the \ninitial days of ESOP’s in India, small organisations who were cash strapped used to \ngive ESOP’s to their employees to increase the overall pay package. In this manner, \nthey  were  able  to  compensate  the  employees  in  kind without  affecting  their  cash \nreserves (if a organisation issues ESOP’s6 its cash reserves are not affected). \nc.  Equity shares with differential rights: \n    Rule 4 of the Companies (Share Capital and Debentures) Rules 2014 deals with \nequity shares with differential rights. The differential rights regime has undergone a \nsignificant  change  with  the  coming  into  effect  of  the  provisions  of  the  2013  Act. \nUnder the 1956 Act, the provisions governing issue of shares with differential rights \ndid not apply to purely private companies. There was therefore sufficient freedom to \nstructure the contractual terms agreed between parties to a joint venture should they \nchoose a purely private company as the JV vehicle. Without going into the issue as to \nwhether  the  exemption  available  for  purely  private companies  should  have \ncontinued,  what  requires  to  be  clarified  immediately  is  that  the  actions  taken  by \npurely  private  companies  under  the  provisions  of  the  1956  Act  will  continue  to \nremain valid. This would help avoid confusion as to whether beginning 1 April 2014, \nthe provisions of the 2013 Act will be applicable notwithstanding actions duly taken \nunder the 1956 Act, although the legal basis for such an interpretation is not very \nsound.  Under  the  2013  Act  and  rules  governing  issue  of  shares  with  differential \nrights, it is specified that shares with differential rights shall not exceed 26% of the \ntotal post issue paid up equity share capital. This 26% includes equity shares issued \nwith differential rights issued at any point in time.

This  is  possibly  to  address  a  situation  where  parties  would  have \nattempted  to  convert  existing  shares  into  differential  shares  by  adopting  a  strict \ninterpretation that such conversion does not amount to ‘issue’ and therefore will not \nbe subject to the limit prescribed. \nWhich Company may issue: \n    A company limited by shares shall issue equity shares with differential rights as \nto  dividend,  voting  or  otherwise,  when  it  complies with  the  following  conditions, \nnamely:6 \n(a)   The  articles  of  association  of  the  company  authorize  the  issue  of  shares  with \ndifferential rights. \n(b)   The issue of shares is authorized by an ordinary resolution passed at a general \nmeeting of the shareholders.

Project  Company. The  project  company  is  the  legal  entity  that  will own, \ndevelop,  construct,  operate  and  maintain  the  project.  The  project  company  is \ngenerally an SPV (Special Purpose Vehicle) created in the project host country and \ntherefore subject to the laws of that country (unless appropriate ‘commissions’ can \nbe  paid  so  that  key  government  officials  can  grant ‘exceptions’  to  the  project). A \nproject company can be created in one of two ways:  \n• when the host government solicits bids and selects the best candidate among the \nbidders;  \n• or a company or group of companies may initiate a project on their own, with or \nwithout soliciting host government involvement.  \n    However, most projects have  government involvement and backing.

Shareholders’ agreement. A shareholders' agreement sets out the respective \nrights  and  obligations  of  the  sponsors  with  respect  to  each  other  and  the  project \ncompany,  with  a  strictly  controlled  dividend  policy.  In  project  financing,  special \nattention is paid to the handling of potential conflicts of interests.

A  credit  agreement  is  the  principal  legal  document \nbetween the banks and the project company that details the express terms on which \nthe banks will advance funds to the project company together with any associated \nsecurity documents. Some of the issues parties will need to consider are: \n• The currency of the loans (should they be denominated in the principal currency \nof expenditure or the currency of the projected revenues?); \n• the manageability of the drawdown and reporting requirements from the project \ncompany's point of view;  \n• Whether any control amount requirements reflect local legal requirements. \n    10.

A supply agreement between the project company and \nthe  supplier  varies  in  sensitivity  depending  on  the  raw  material  or  fuel  used  by  a \nproject and the source and ownership of supplied material. Security of supply and \nprice certainty is of key importance for the project.

Such capital is in the form of \ndifferent current assets and they change their form in the ordinary course of business \ne.g. from cash to inventories, inventories to receivable and receivables into cash. \n    Hoagland defines it as, “the difference between the book value of the current \nassets and the current liabilities. \n    In his view, Gestenberg called it as a circulating capital.  \nThe  most  widely  used  concept  of  working  capital  is defined  as,  \"the  difference \nbetween  current  assets  and  current  liabilities.\"  This  concept  is  useful  to know  the \nliquidity of the firm.  \n4.2. A.2 Types of Working Capital: \n    There are different concepts/types of working capital having different meanings \nwhich are explained as follows – \n    1. Gross  working  capital  –  It  is  a  broad  concept  of  working  capital. \nAccording to this concept working capital means the total of all current assets of the \nfirm.  This  concept  is  important  from  view  point  of management  because  the \nmanagement can plan for the working capital well in advance and use effectively all \nthe current assets. As per this concept working capital and current assets are the two \ninter-changeable terms. \n    2. Net  working  capital  –  According  to  this  concept  the  working  capital \nmeans the net current assets that mean current assets minus current liabilities. This \nconcept is widely current assets used.  It is used to find out the soundness of short \nterm financial position of the firm by the concerned parties. \n    3. Negative working capital – It means the excess of current liabilities over \nthe current assets. It is opposite to net working capital. Negative working capital is \nalso called as working capital deficit. It shows that the working capital position of the \nfirm is not good.

If  the  firm  is  a  trading  firm  it \nrequires  more  working  capital  and  if  the  firm  is  an  industrial  or  public  utilities \nconcern it requires less working capital.  \n    iii)  Volume  of  business:  If the volume of business is large it requires more \nworking capital and if the volume of business is small there is a less need of working \ncapital.  \n    iv)  Length of processing or selling period: If the processing or selling period \nis large it requires more working capital and vice versa. \n    v)  Policy of purchase and sale: The requirement of working capital depends \nupon the firm's policy of purchase and sale. If a firm has a policy of cash purchases \nand credit sales it requires more working capital and if a firm has a policy of credit \npurchases and cash sales it requires less working capital.

B Sources of Working Capital: \n    Working capital finance generally refers to debt raised for a period of less than a \nyear from Term Lending Institutions, Commercial Banks and Non-Banking Finance \nCompanies (NBFC) catering to the short-term credit needs of the business entities. \nThere are different sources of working capital. These sources are as follows:  \n4.2. B. 1: Accruals: \n    It is an internal source of working capital finance. In addition to the sources of \nraising finance for working capital needs, one more source in the form of accrued \nexpenses or outstanding expenses is available. Like trade credit, this source also does \nnot actually generate funds but it only postpones the payment of certain expenses. \nThe greater is the postponement, the greater is the amount available for financing. \nBut legal aspects should be taken into consideration before using this source. \n    Internal funds are very important source of financing short-term obligations. It is \na spontaneous source of meeting the working capital needs. Such accounts are self-\ngenerating  and  available  immediately.  The  most  common  accruals  are  wages  and \nsalaries,  taxes,  short-terms  obligations,  retained earnings  and  depreciation  fund ","metadata":{"source":"C:\\Users\\Vedant\\Documents\\Projects\\JPMC-CFG\\Team-2\\server\\assets\\dataset\\business_finance.pdf","pdf":{"version":"1.10.100","info":{"PDFFormatVersion":"1.4","IsAcroFormPresent":false,"IsXFAPresent":false,"Producer":"iLovePDF","ModDate":"D:20240615143501Z"},"metadata":null,"totalPages":344},"loc":{"pageNumber":118}}}],["c4620f82-5719-4302-a7cf-2b0240c3da61",{"pageContent":" \n120\namounts. Amount kept aside for payment of salaries and wages can be a good source, \nsince the payment has to be made on a fixed date. Similarly, a provision for tax is \ncreated out of the profits but the taxes are paid only after assessment is finalized. \nThus the time-interval between the receipt of income and actual payment helps the \nbusiness  in  meeting  some  of  its  short-term  requirements.  In  addition  the  profits \nearned  by  the  company  remain  with  the  company  till the  dividend  and  interest \npayments are made. Some amount is available from the depreciation fund also. All \nsuch accrual accounts become an important source for working capital needs. When \nthe size of the business grows, amount of accrual also increases. This enables the \nfirm to finance its short-term obligations. Accruals vary with the level of activity of \nthe firm. When the activity level expands, accruals increase and when the activity \nlevel shortened accruals decrease. It is costless and interest free and internal source \nof financing.  There are no formalities involved. Accruals do not create any change \non the assets of the company. But there are some shortcomings of this source such as \ntemporary source of finance, a company cannot use such amount indefinitely, trade \nunions will oppose, if the employees are not paid on time, it might reduce the morale \nof the employees, it may lead to lower efficiency and high labour turnover. Hence, \ninternal accruals as a source of working capital should be used only in the last. Yet \nsome companies who are having shortage of funds can resort to this source.  \n4.2. B. 2: Trade Credit \n    Trade  credit  represents  the  credit  extended  by  the  suppliers  of  goods  and \nservices. It is a form of short-term financing of working capital needs. It is available \nand common to all types of business firms. In actual practice, it is the largest source \nof short-term funds. It is an important source of finance representing 25% to 50% of \nshort term financing.  Almost in all modern economies, buyers are not required to \npay  for  goods  on  delivery.  They  are  allowed  a  short-term  credit  period  before \npayment  becomes  due.  The  confidence  of  suppliers  is  the  key  to  securing  trade \ncredit. This credit may take the form of either Open account credit arrangement or \nAcceptance credit arrangement.  \n    In an open account credit arrangement, the buyer is not required to sign a formal \ndebt instrument. The seller does not ask the buyer to sign any instrument as evidence \nfor the amount due. The seller trusts the buyer and expects him to pay the price after \nthe credit period expires. In case of acceptance credit arrangement the buyer accepts \na bill of exchange or gives a promissory note for the amount due by him. Thus, it is ","metadata":{"source":"C:\\Users\\Vedant\\Documents\\Projects\\JPMC-CFG\\Team-2\\server\\assets\\dataset\\business_finance.pdf","pdf":{"version":"1.10.100","info":{"PDFFormatVersion":"1.4","IsAcroFormPresent":false,"IsXFAPresent":false,"Producer":"iLovePDF","ModDate":"D:20240615143501Z"},"metadata":null,"totalPages":344},"loc":{"pageNumber":119}}}],["5098544b-02fb-4b05-bfb1-ffe0bca102e1",{"pageContent":" \n121\nan arrangement by which the creditworthiness of the buyer is recognized formally. \nThe buyer has to pay the amount of the bill or note after a stipulated time or on a \nspecified date.  \n    Trade credit arrangement is generally made available to the buyer on informal \nbasis. It does not create any charge on the assets. Such arrangement usually allows a \ncash discount to the buyer for prompt payment. The volume of trade credit and its \nuse can be a good source of short-term financing. The amount available depends on \nthe following factors (i) The terms of trade credit, (ii) reputation of the purchasing \nfirm, (iii) financial position of the seller and (iv) volume of purchases by the buyer. \nThis source is beneficial because it does not create any charge on the asset of the \nbuyer, readily available, flexible and continuous source of financing.  But the cost of \ntrade credit may be very high. The firm or company should balance the advantages \nagainst disadvantages of trade credit. It should be resorted to considering the price \nloss  of  discount  and  possibility  of  deterioration  in  reputation.  Hence  a  company \nshould have a selective approach in using trade credit. It should not be stretched too \nmuch and beyond limits.  \n4. 2. B. 3: Commercial Banks \n    The commonly used source for financing working capital needs is the finance by \ncommercial  banks.  Normally,  a  bank  assesses  the  requirements  of  customers  for \nworking capital needs. This assessment is done on the basis of the sales level as well \nas  production  plans  of  the  firm.  How  much  amount  of  current  assets  should  be \nmaintained is also assessed by the bank. After deducting the margin money from the \ntotal  requirements,  the  balance  amount  is  financed by  the  bank.  There  may  be \nseparate financing limits for peak periods and non-peak periods.  \na)   Fund-based:  \n 1)  Overdrafts:  An  overdraft  is  a  temporary  accommodation  by  the  bank  by \nwhich  a  borrower  is  allowed  to  overdraw  his  current  account  up  to  a  fixed  limit, \nusually  against  collateral  securities  such  as  hypothecation  of  marketable  shares, \nstocks or bonds. This system operates exactly on similar lines to that of cash credits, \nthe only difference being that an overdraft is intended to be used only temporarily, \nwhereas a cash credit is used regularly and for longer periods.  ","metadata":{"source":"C:\\Users\\Vedant\\Documents\\Projects\\JPMC-CFG\\Team-2\\server\\assets\\dataset\\business_finance.pdf","pdf":{"version":"1.10.100","info":{"PDFFormatVersion":"1.4","IsAcroFormPresent":false,"IsXFAPresent":false,"Producer":"iLovePDF","ModDate":"D:20240615143501Z"},"metadata":null,"totalPages":344},"loc":{"pageNumber":120}}}],["a2d3af39-1325-4a36-828a-77016b85ed0f",{"pageContent":" \n122\n    This  is  most  common  method  of  bank  financing.  A  customer  is  allowed  to \nwithdraw more amount than the balance to his credit in the account. For example, if \nbank  balance  to  the  credit  of  a  customer  is  Rs.  20.000  he  may  be  allowed  to \nwithdraw  Rs.  30.000  thus  indicating  that  there  is  a  bank  overdraft  of  Rs.  10.000. \nHow much amount is allowed to be withdrawn as overdraft depends upon the limit \nsanctioned by the bank. The limits are decided after a careful scrutiny of the bank \naccount transactions of the customer. Interest is charged only on the amount which is \nwithdrawn as overdraft. Like trade credit, bank overdraft arrangements can also offer \nwide flexibility once relations between the bank and the customer are developed.  \n 2) Cash Credit: Cash credit refers to a system of financing where a borrower is \nprovided a credit limit, which could be utilized by him for the purpose of running \nday-to-day business. The limits are decided based on his overall cash requirement of \nthe business. The calculation is based on the total operating cycle and gap between \npayment to be received and to be made.  \n    Like  overdraft,  in  this  method  also,  a  bank  sanctions  a  particular  limit  up  to \nwhich  a  borrower  can  borrow.  It  is  not  necessary  for  a  borrower  to  withdraw  the \nentire  amount  of  borrowing  immediately.  He  can  withdraw  the  amount  as  per  his \nrequirements. Interest is charged only on the amount withdrawn and not on the entire \namount  sanctioned.  A  bank  may  demand  security  in  the  form  of  a  current  asset. \nSimilar  to  overdraft,  cash  credit  also  offers  wide flexibility  and  therefore  is  very \npopular method of financing \n 3)  Working  Capital  Loan:  In  addition  to  the  above  mentioned  methods, \nsometimes temporary working capital loans may also be sanctioned by the bank. This \nrefers to the working capital limit of a borrower extended to him in the form of a \nloan.  The  loan  component  covers  the  permanent  part of  the  working  capital  need \nwhile cash credit component caters to the fluctuating part of the limit. The interest is \ncharged on the loan component irrespective of utilization when such a term loan is \navailed. Since small firms do not generally possess expertise in managing loan funds \nin  case  of  low  utilization  of  limits  and  also  have lower  control  on  their  working \ncapital management, carving out a loan component is not mandatory in their case.  \n 4) Bills Financing: Bills are negotiable instruments that the buyer agrees to pay \nthe drawer/payee the value of the goods after a specified period of time.

Bank financing against \nbills  is  in  the  form  of  either  discounting  or  purchase.  In  case  of  discounting,  the \nbanker  credits  the  client's  account  for  the  bill  amount  (less  discount  for  meeting \ninterest charges for a remaining number of days to maturity) and collects the bill as \nan agent of the client. In case of purchase, the banker assumes ownership of the bill \nand claims it in his own right.  \n 5)  Bills  discounting: A bill of exchange which is drawn by a creditor on his \ndebtor is a negotiable instrument. It contains an unconditional order to pay a certain \nsum of money after a certain period of time to the creditor. But the creditor has to \nwait  till  the  maturity  date  before  he  receives  the payment.  His  money  remains \nblocked till the period is over.  In order to remove this difficulty, the creditor can \ndiscount the bill with his bank. The bank deducts certain amount as commission from \nthe amount of the bill and the remaining amount is paid to the creditor. However, \nbefore giving this facility to the drawer or the creditor, the credit rating of the drawer \nis checked by the bank.  \n 6)  Export  financing:  This  financial  instrument  is  offered  in  case  of  goods \nexported  from  the  country  in  order  to  arbitrage  on lower  interest  rates  abroad.  In \norder  to  offset  the  disadvantage  of  higher  interest  rates  in  India  faced  by  units \ncompeting in export markets, banks extend concessional financing for exports. The \nexport financing can be broadly classified into: \na.  Pre-shipment credit - Such financing is provided for meeting costs related to \npurchase  of  goods,  processing,  packing  and  shipping.  Pre-shipment  credit  is \navailable  both  in  rupees  as  well  as  in  foreign  currency  depending  upon  the \nrequirement.  \nb.  Post-shipment  credit  -  Post-shipment  credit  is  provided  for  financing  the \nexporter subsequent to dispatch of goods until realization of sales proceeds from \nthe  foreign  buyer  as  per  the  terms  of  the  transaction  or  the  letter  of  credit \nreceived from the foreign buyer's banker.  \n    Other  forms  of  Export  financing  include  Foreign  usance  bills  (FBE),  and \nForeign  Demand  Bills  (FDB),  Foreign  L/Cs  (FLCs)  and  Export  Performance \nGuarantees.

The security may be in the form of hypothecation, pledge, mortgage \nor lien. \nb)   Non-fund based/Documentary Credit instruments:  \n    These  are  commercial  documents  guaranteeing  payment  by  the  bank  to  the \nbeneficiary,  who  is  usually  the  seller  of  merchandise,  against  the  underlying \ntransaction.  \n 1) Letter of credit: Through a letter of credit issued by a bank, it commits to \nhonour  the  payment  terms  of  the  underlying  transaction  if  the  seller  delivers  the \ngoods as stipulated in the contract. It could be issued either for domestic transaction \nor for international trade, most typically for the latter because of the long gestation \nperiods involved.  \n 2)  Letter  of  guarantee: A letter of guarantee is issued by a banker to a third \nparty indicating that the bank would meet the financial consequences (to a specified \namount) in the event of failure of its client in adhering to the terms of the contract \nwith the third party.   \n 3) Deferred payment guarantee: Typically in case of equipment financing, the \nmanufacturer (by itself/through a financing tie-up) offers credit to the buyers of its \nequipment  at  attractive  terms  to  generate  additional  demand  for  its  products.  The \nDeferred  Payment  Guarantee  (DPG)  is  a  bank  facility  where  the  bank  extends  a \nguarantee to the  equipment manufacturer on behalf of its client that the  financing \nextended by the manufacturer (by himself or through its preferred financier) would \nbe repaid as per the terms agreed upon.  \n4. 2. B. 4: Public Deposits \n    Public  deposits  constitute  an  important  source  of business  finance  in  Indian \nindustries. Many firms, large and small, have solicited unsecured deposits from the \npublic  in  recent  years,  mainly  to  finance  their  working  capital  requirements. \nEspecially, such deposits are found in sugar, cotton textiles, engineering, chemicals \nand trading concerns. They are mainly a source of short-term finance, but they have \nalso  been  utilized  to  provide  long  and  medium  term finance  also.  Initially,  these \ndeposits were received from the public, the shareholders and the employees of the \nmills.

Then the growth of \nsuch  deposits  has  been  considerable  after  the  third  five  year  plan.  Taking  into \naccount the shortage of funds from the capital market, many companies attempted to \nraise funds needed by them directly from the public offering more interest rates than \nbanks.  In  order  to  avoid  competition  between  the  companies  and  the  banks  in \nobtaining such deposits, The Reserve Bank of  India has laid down  restrictions on \nthese deposits.  \nAdvantages : \n1.   The cost of deposits is lower than the rate of interest charged by the banks.  \n2.   They do not create any charge on the assets of the company.  \n3.   They  introduce  an  element  of  flexibility  in  the  financial  structure  of  the \ncompany.  \n4.   The  company  can  adopt  a  liberal  dividend  policy  as  the  rate  of  interest  on \ndeposits is fixed. It helps in enhancing the prestige of the company.  \n5.

Such deposits affect the business of the banks adversely. Banks may not be in a \nposition to attract deposits, if the companies are allowed to accept the deposits.  \nLegal Provisions for Public Deposits  \n    Initially in 1974, the Reserve Bank of India appointed a Study Group under the \nchairmanship  of  James  Raj,  chairman  of  the  Unit  Trust  of  India.

The important features of these regulations are as follows:  \n1. Public deposits cannot exceed 25% of paid-up share capital and free reserves. \n2. The minimum period for which companies will be able to accept deposits will \nbe 6 months and maximum 36 months.  \n3. The company had to deposit or invest in scheduled bank at least 10% of deposits \nmaturing during the year. The amount set aside can be used only for repaying \nsuch deposits. \n4. A company inviting deposits from the public is required to disclose certain facts \nabout its financial performance and position. \n    Section 58 of the Indian Companies Act is deals with the public deposits.

An inter-corporate deposit is, the deposit made by one corporate body \n(company) with another company. Such deposits are usually made for a maximum \nperiod of six months. It can be a good source of working capital.  \nTypes of Deposits : Such deposits may generally be of three types.  \n    (a)  Call Deposits : Such deposits are payable on call. They are repayable on \ncall or as soon as demand is made. It can be just one or two-three days’ notice to get \nthe amount back.  \n    (b)  Three  Months  Deposits  :  These  inter-corporate  deposits  are  made  for  a \nperiod of three months. Such deposits have been found to be most popular among the \ncompanies.  Some  companies  have  surplus  funds  while some  are  in  need  of  such \nshort-term funds.  \n    (c)  Six  Months  Deposits  :  These  deposits  are  made  for  six  months  by  the \ncompanies. Generally, they are made for a maximum of 6 months and that too with A \ncategory companies only.  \n Legal provisions : The Companies Act (Section 372 A) makes provisions for \ninter-corporate deposits.  \n1.   They are in the nature of unsecured deposits.  \n2.   Such deposits are made on the basis of credits worthiness and willingness of the \ncompany concerned.  \n3.   A Company cannot make deposits, loans and guarantees all the three together. \nThe amount cannot be more than 60% of its net worth plus free reserves or cent \npercent of its free reserves, whichever is more. \n4.

B. 6: Short-term Loans from Financial Institutions \n    Financial institutions at the national and state level provide short-term funds to \nthe business units. The financial institutions can be broadly classified into national \nfinancial  institutions  and  state  level  financial  institutions.  The  Life  Insurance \nCorporation of India and the General Insurance Corporation of India provide short \nterm loans to manufacturing companies. \n    A  company  is  to  be  eligible  to  receive  short  term loans  should  satisfy  the \nfollowing conditions: \n1. It should have declared an annual dividend of not less than 6% for the past five \nyears with certain relaxation. \n2. The debt-equity ratio of the company should not exceed 2:1. \n3. The current ratio of the company should be at least 1:1. \n4. The average of the interest cover ratios for the past three years should be at least \n2:1. \nFeatures: \nThe short term loans provided by financial institutions have the following features; \n1. They are unsecured and are given on the strength of a demand promissory note. \n2. The  loan  is  given  for  a  period  of  one  year  and  can be  renewed  for  two \nconsecutive years, provided the original eligibility criteria are satisfied. \n3. After a loan is repaid, the company will have to wait for at least 6 months before \navailing of a fresh loan. \n    The  form  of  assistance  can  be  broadly  classified  into  direct  and  indirect \nassistance. The basic feature of direct assistance is that financial institutions provide \nfunds directly to the project. In indirect assistance, the institutions provide guarantee \non behalf of promoters of the project.  In addition to long-term funding, they  give \nmargin money for working capital.

Working capital management ensures \na company has sufficient cash flow in order to meet its short-term debt obligations \nand operating expenses. \n    According  to  Investopedia,  implementing  an  effective  working  capital \nmanagement  system  is  an  excellent  way  for  many  companies  to  improve  their \nearnings. The two main aspect of working capital management are ratio analysis and \nmanagement of individual components of working capital. \n    A few key performance ratios of a working capital management system are the \nworking capital ratio, inventory turnover and the collection ratio. Ratio analysis will \nlead  management  to  identify  areas  of  focus  such  as inventory  management,  cash \nmanagement, accounts receivable and payable management.  \n    The  importance  of  working  capital  management  is  reflected  in  the  fact  that \nfinancial managers spend a great deal of time in managing current assets and current \nliabilities.  Arranging  short-term  financing,  negotiating  favourable  credit  terms, \ncontrolling  cash  movement,  managing  accounts  receivables  and  monitoring \ninvestments in inventories consume a great deal of time of financial managers. \n    Working capital, in general practice, refers to the excess of current assets over \ncurrent liabilities. Management of working capital therefore, is concerned with the \nproblems that arise in attempting to manage the current assets, the current liabilities \nand  the  inter-relationship  that  exists  between  them.  In  other  words  it  refers  to  all \naspects of administration of both current assets and current liabilities.  \n    The basic goal of working capital management is to manage the current assets \nand current liabilities of a firm in such a way that a satisfactory level of working \ncapital is maintained, i.e., it is neither inadequate nor excessive. This is so because \nboth  inadequate  as  well  as  excessive  working  capital  positions  are  bad  for  any \nbusiness.  Inadequacy  of  working  capital  may  lead  the  firm  to  insolvency  and \nexcessive working capital implies idle funds which earn no profits for the business. \nWorking  capital  management  policies  of  a  firm  have a  great  effect  on  its \nprofitability, liquidity and structural health of the organization. \nNeed For Working Capital Management:  \n1.

It  is  therefore  indispensable  to  manage  the  current \nassets properly and efficiently.  \n2.   More than half of the total capital of the firm is generally invested in current \nassets. It means less than half of the capital is blocked in fixed assets. We pay \ndue attention to the management of fixed assets through the capital budgeting \nprocess. Management of working capital too, therefore, attracts the attention of \nthe management. \n3.   In  emergency  (non-availability  of  funds  etc.)  fixed  assets  can  be  acquired  on \nlease but there is no alternative for current assets. Investment in current assets, \ni.e., inventory or receivables can in no way be avoided without sustaining loss.  \n4.   Working capital needs are more often financed through outside sources so it is \nnecessary to utilize them in the best way possible.  \n5.   The management of working capital is more important for small units because \nthey scarcely rely on long term capital market and have an easy access to short \nterm financial sources i.e. trade credit, short term bank loan etc.  \n6.   In the modem system approach to management, the operations of the firm are \nviewed as a total that is an integrated system. In this sense it is not possible to \nstudy one segment of the firm individually or leave it out completely. Hence, an \noverall look on the management of working capital is necessary. \nProcess of Working capital management  \n    Working  Capital  means  current  assets  such  as  cash,  accounts  receivable  and \ninventory etc. minus the current liabilities. The management of current assets is as \nimportant as or rather more important than the management of fixed assets because, \nthe fate of most of the business very largely depends upon the manner in which their \nworking capital is managed.

C.1: Cash Management \n    Cash is one of the current assets of a business. It is needed at all times to keep \nthe  business  going.  A  business  concern  should  always  keep  sufficient  cash  for \nmeeting its obligations. Taking into consideration the importance of cash in business \nthe  management  of  cash  become  very  important.  Cash management  refers  to \nmanagement of cash balance and the bank balance including the short terms deposits. \nThe following discussion explains the meaning of cash as well as cash management. \nMeaning of Cash: \n    Cash is one of the current assets of a business. It is needed at all times to keep \nthe  business  going.  A  business  concern  should  always  keep  sufficient  cash  for \nmeeting its obligations. Any shortage of cash will hamper the operation of a concern \nand any excess of it will be unproductive. Cash is the most unproductive of all the \nassets.  While  fixed  assets  like  machinery,  plant,  etc.  and  current  assets  such  as \ninventory will help the business in increasing its earning capacity, cash in hand will \nnot add anything to the concern.  \n    There  are two ways of  viewing the term  'cash'.  In a narrow sense it includes \nactual cash in the form of notes and coins and bank drafts held by a firm and the \ndeposits  withdraw  able  on  demand.  And  in  a  broader sense,  it  includes  even \nmarketable securities which can be immediately sold or converted into cash.  \n    Thus,  cash  is  the  balancing  figures  between  debtors,  stock  and  creditors. \nWithout adequate cash to meet working capital demands, it is impossible to extend \ncredit, order stock or pay creditors. To understand the meaning of the term cash it is \nnecessary to know the nature of cash, motives for holding cash and also the factors ","metadata":{"source":"C:\\Users\\Vedant\\Documents\\Projects\\JPMC-CFG\\Team-2\\server\\assets\\dataset\\business_finance.pdf","pdf":{"version":"1.10.100","info":{"PDFFormatVersion":"1.4","IsAcroFormPresent":false,"IsXFAPresent":false,"Producer":"iLovePDF","ModDate":"D:20240615143501Z"},"metadata":null,"totalPages":344},"loc":{"pageNumber":134}}}],["ad8b20cd-f893-4dfd-a040-7470090168e2",{"pageContent":" \n136\naffecting the cash balance. Cash is an asset but it is an idle asset because cash doesn't \nproduce anything by itself. Cash is an unproductive or least productive asset which \ndoes not earn any profit for the firm. Shortage of cash harms the operations of a firm \nand there is a cost of cash shortage also. Minimum level of cash is necessary to carry \non business activities. This level is also known as critical level of cash. There are \ndifferent motives for holding cash. The firm's needs for cash may be attributed to the \nvarious  motives/needs  such  as  Transactions  motive, Precautionary  motive, \nSpeculative motive and Compensation motive. Some people are of the view that a \nbusiness requires cash only for the first two motives while others feel that speculative \nmotive also remains. A firm needs cash for making transactions in the day to day \noperations. A firm is required to keep cash for meeting various contingencies. The \nspeculative motive relates to holding of cash for investing in profitable opportunities \nas and when they arise. A minimum cash balance should be maintained by a firm for \ndifferent security deposits and this is known as the compensation motive for holding \ncash. The various factors affecting the cash balance are like Credit Position of the \nFirm,  Status  of  Firm's  Receivable,  Status  of  Firm's  Inventory  Account,  Nature  of \nBusiness  Enterprise,  Managements  Attitude  towards  Risk,  Amount  of  Sales  in \nRelation to Assets,Cash Inflows and Cash Outflows, Cost of Cash Balance etc. \nMeaning of Cash Management: \n    Cash management refers to management of cash balance and the bank balance \nincluding the short terms deposits. For cash management purposes, the term cash is \nused  in  this  broader  sense,  i.e.,  it  covers  cash,  cash  equivalents  and  those  assets \nwhich  are  immediately  convertible  into  cash.  A  financial  manager  is  required  to \nmanage the cash flows (both inflows and outflows) arising out of the operations of \nthe firm. Cash management, deals with optimization of cash as an asset and for this \npurpose the financial manager has to take various decisions from time to time. He \nhas to deal as the cash flows director of the firm. Even if a firm is highly profitable, \nits cash inflows may not exactly match the cash outflows. He has to manipulate and \nsynchronize the two for the advantage of the firm by investing excess cash if any as \nwell as arranging funds to cover the deficiency.  \nObjectives of Cash Management: \nThe basic objectives of cash management are two-fold:  ","metadata":{"source":"C:\\Users\\Vedant\\Documents\\Projects\\JPMC-CFG\\Team-2\\server\\assets\\dataset\\business_finance.pdf","pdf":{"version":"1.10.100","info":{"PDFFormatVersion":"1.4","IsAcroFormPresent":false,"IsXFAPresent":false,"Producer":"iLovePDF","ModDate":"D:20240615143501Z"},"metadata":null,"totalPages":344},"loc":{"pageNumber":135}}}],["2e7bf5ca-24f3-498d-9518-25cf7388e06f",{"pageContent":" \n137\n 1) Meeting the Payment Schedule: In the normal course of business firms have \nto make payments of cash on a continuous and regular basis to suppliers of goods, \nemployees and so on. At the same time, there is a constant inflow of cash through \ncollections  from  debtors.  A  basic  objective  of  cash  management  is  to  meet  the \npayment schedule, i.e., to have sufficient cash to meet the cash disbursement needs \nof a firm. The importance of sufficient cash to meet the payment schedule can hardly \nbe over-emphasized. The advantages of adequate cash are:  \ni)    It prevents insolvency or bankruptcy arising out of the inability of a firm to meet \nits obligations  \nii)   The relationship with the bank is not strained;  \niii)   It  helps  in  fostering  good  relations  with  trade  creditors  and  suppliers  of  raw \nmaterials, as prompt payment may help their own cash management;  \niv)   A trade discount can be availed of if payment is made within the due date;  \nv)   It leads to a strong credit rating which enables the firm to purchase goods on \nfavorable terms and to maintain its line of credit with banks and other resources \nof credit;  \nvi)   To  take  advantage  of  favorable  business  opportunities  that  may  be  available \nperiodically;  \nvii)  Finally, the firm can meet unanticipated cash expenditure with a minimum of \nstrain during emergencies, such as strikes, fires or a new marketing campaign by \ncompetitors.

In minimizing the cash balances two \nconflicting  aspects  have  to  be  reconciled.  A  high  level  of  cash  balances  will,  as \nshown above, ensure prompt payment together with all the advantages. But it also \nimplies that large funds will remain idle, as cash is a non-earning asset and the firm \nwill have to forego profits. A low level of cash balances, on the other hand, may \nmean failure to meet the payment schedule. The aim of cash management should be \nto have an optimal amount of cash balances.

The cash \ncycle refers to the process by which cash is used to purchase materials from which \ngoods are produced, which are then sold to customers, who later pay the bills. The \nfirm  receives  cash  from  customers  and  the  cycle  repeats  itself.  The  cash  turnover \nmeans the number of times cash is used during each year. The cash cycle involves \nseveral steps along the way as funds flow from the firm's accounts, as shown in table \nbelow:  \nDetails of Cash Cycle  \nA = Materials ordered    D = Cheque clearance G = Payment received \nB = Materials received   E = Goods sold H = Cheques deposited \nC = Payments F = Customer mails payments    I = Funds collected \n    In addressing the issue of cash management strategies, we are concerned with \nthe time periods involved in stages B, C, D, and F, G, H, I. A firm has no control \nover  the  time  involved  between  stages  A  and  B.  The lag  between  D  and  E  is \ndetermined by the production process and inventory policy. The time period between \nstages E and F is determined by credit terms and the payments policy of customers. \n    The higher the cash turnover, the less is the cash a firm requires. A firm should, \ntherefore,  try  to  maximize  the  cash  turnover.  But  it  must  maintain  a  minimum \namount of operating cash balance so that it does not run out of cash. The minimum \nlevel of operating cash is determined by dividing the total operating annual outlays \nby the cash turnover rate. \n    Cash  Management  Strategies  are  intended  to  minimize  the  operating  cash \nbalance requirement. The basic strategies that can be employed to do the needful are \nas follows:  \n1)   Stretching Accounts Payable:  \n    One  basic  strategy  of  efficient  cash  management  is  to  stretch  the  accounts \npayable. In other words, a firm should pay its accounts payable as late as possible \nwithout damaging its credit standing. It should, however, take advantage of the cash \ndiscount available on prompt payment  ","metadata":{"source":"C:\\Users\\Vedant\\Documents\\Projects\\JPMC-CFG\\Team-2\\server\\assets\\dataset\\business_finance.pdf","pdf":{"version":"1.10.100","info":{"PDFFormatVersion":"1.4","IsAcroFormPresent":false,"IsXFAPresent":false,"Producer":"iLovePDF","ModDate":"D:20240615143501Z"},"metadata":null,"totalPages":344},"loc":{"pageNumber":137}}}],["be24cfb6-305d-4e67-97dd-ae04d18bab6b",{"pageContent":" \n139\n2)   Efficient Inventory-Production Management:  \n    Another strategy is to increase the inventory turnover, avoiding stock-outs, that \nis, and shortage of stock. This can be done in the following ways:  \ni)    Increasing the raw materials turnover by using more efficient inventory control \ntechniques.  \nii)   Decreasing the production cycle through better production planning, scheduling \nand  control  techniques;  it  will  lead  to  an  increase  in  the  work-in-progress \ninventory turnover.  \niii)   Increasing the finished goods turnover through better forecasting of demand and \na better planning of production.  \n    Thus,  efficient  inventory  and  production  management  causes  a  decline  in  the \noperating cash requirement and, hence, a saving in cash operating cost.  \n3)   Speeding Collection of Accounts Receivable:  \n    Yet  another  strategy  for  efficient  cash  management  is  to  collect  accounts \nreceivable as quickly as possible without losing future sales because of high-pressure \ncollection techniques. The average collection period of receivables can be reduced by \nchanges in: i) Credit terms, ii) Credit standards, and iii) Collection policies. In brief, \ncredit  standards  represent  the  criteria  for  determining  to  whom  credit  should  be \nextended.

It protects the \nfinancial  condition  of  the  firm  by  developing  a  projected  cash  statement  from  a \nforecast of expected cash inflows and outflows for a given period. The forecast may \nbe based on the present operations or the anticipated future operations. Cash plans \nare very crucial in developing the overall operating plans of the firm. \n    Cash planning may be done on daily, weekly or monthly basis. The period and \nfrequency  of  cash  planning  generally  depends  upon  the  size  of  the  firms  and \nphilosophy  of  the  management.  Large  firms  prepare  daily  and  weekly  forecasts. \nMedium-size firms usually prepare weekly and monthly forecasts. Small firms may \nnot prepare formal cash forecasts because of the non-availability of information and \nsmall-scale operations. But, if the small firms prepare cash projections, it is done on \nmonthly  basis.  As  a  firm  grows  and  business  operations  become  complex,  cash \nplanning becomes inevitable for its continuing success. In order to take care of all \nthese considerations, the firm should prepare a cash budget.   \n2)   Cash Management Control: \n    The efficiency of the firm's cash management program can be enhanced by the \nknowledge and use of various procedures aimed at: Accelerating cash inflows, and \ncontrolling cash outflows.  \ni)    Accelerating Cash Inflows: \n    Efficient  cash  management  is  possible  only  when  the  collections  of  cash  are \naccelerated. The delay between the time customers pay their dues and the time the \ncash is collected in the sense of becoming useable by the firm should be attempted to \nbe reduced to the extent possible. Collection process may be speeded up in any of the \nfollowing manners:  \na)   The mailing time of payment from customers to the firm may be reduced.  \nb)   The time during which payments received by the firm remain uncollected may \nbe minimized. It includes the time a company takes in processing the cheques \ninternally and the time consumed in the clearance of the cheques through the \nbanking system.

It is the level which gives the minimum cost of holding the \nliquid balance. Determination of such a level is very important for an efficient cash \nmanagement.

The point which gives the \nminimum total cost is the point of optimum liquidity balance—representing a trade-\noff of shortage costs against opportunity costs.  \n4)   Investing Surplus Cash: \n    Cash not required for temporary periods of short durations can be invested in \nnear-cash assets, i.e., marketable securities which are readily convertible into cash. \nEven though the cash is temporarily ideal, it should not be kept so because if the firm \nhas an opportunity to earn interest through investing it in marketable securities, why \nshould it not avail of the same. The selection of the securities should, however, be \nmade very cautiously. The criterion for selecting securities may be as Marketability, \nMaturity, Risk of Default, Liquidity, and Yield etc. \n    How much amount should be invested in marketable securities and when should \na security transaction take place is a crucial problem before the financial manager. If \nthe amount and the timing of transactions can be determined, the firm can minimize \nthe costs of maintaining liquid balance.  \nCash Management Models: \n    Two  important  cash  management  models  which  lead  to  determination  of \noptimum balance of cash are - \n1)   Optimum Cash Balance under Certainty: Baumol's Model  \n2)   Optimum Cash Balance under Uncertainty: The Miller-Orr Model  \nThese models are explained in short as follows: \n1)   Optimum Cash Balance under Certainty: Baumol's Model: \n    The  Baumol  cash  management  model  provides  a  formal  approach  for \ndetermining  a  firm's  optimum  cash  balance  under  certainty.  It  considers  cash \nmanagement  similar  to  an  inventory  management  problem.

As the firm spends cash, its cash balance decreases steadily and reaches to \nzero.  The  firm  replenishes  its  cash  balance  to  C  rupees  by  selling  marketable \nsecurities.  This  pattern  continues  over  time.  Since  the  cash  balance  decreases \nsteadily, the average cash balance will be: C/2.  \n    The firm incurs a holding cost for keeping the cash balance. It is an opportunity \ncost; that is, the return foregone on the marketable securities. If the opportunity cost \nis  k,  then  the  firm's  holding  cost  for  maintaining an  average  cash  balance  is  as \nfollow: \n Holding cost = k (C/2)  \n    The firm incurs a transaction cost whenever it converts its marketable securities \nto cash.

However,  the \ntransaction cost reduces because with increasing C the number of transaction will \ndecline. Thus, there is a trade-off between the holding cost and the transaction cost.  \n    The optimum cash balance, C*, is obtained when the total cost is minimum.

C.2: Liquidity Management \n    Liquidity refers to the ability of a concern to meet its current obligations as and \nwhen  these  become  due.  The  short-term  obligations  are  met  by  realizing  amounts \nfrom current, floating or circulating assets. The current assets should either be liquid \nor  near  liquidity.  These  should  be  convertible  into  cash  for  paying  obligations  of \nshort-term  nature.  The  sufficiency  or  insufficiency  of  current  assets  should  be \nassessed by comparing them with short-term/current liabilities. If current assets can \npay off current liabilities, then liquidity position will be satisfactory. On the other \nhand, if current liabilities may not be easily met out of current assets then liquidity \nposition will be bad. The bankers, suppliers of goods and other short-term creditors \nare interested in the liquidity of the concern. They will extend credit only if they are \nsure that current assets are enough to pay out the obligations. \n    Liquidity Management is the management who looks after to maintain the sound \nliquidity  position  of  the  firm.  To  maintain  the  proper  liquidity  in  the  firm, \nmanagement  has  to  measure  it.  To  measure  the  liquidity  of  a  firm  Current  Ratio, \nLiquid Ratio and Absolute Liquid Ratio are used. One of the primary responsibilities \nof the financial manager is to maintain a sound liquidity position of the firm so that \nthe dues are settled in time.

A proper balance has to be maintained \nthrough efficient liquidity management.  \nNeed and Importance of Liquidity Management: \n    The need and importance of liquidity management can be explained as follows:  \n1.   Liquidity gives indication that firm has capacity to meet short-term obligations.  \n2.   It throws light on the efficiency of the collection department.  \n3.

If,  instead  of  one  collection  center,  there  are  a \nnumber of collection centers for the purpose, collections would certainly be speeded \nup. This procedure is named as concentration banking. Through this procedure, the \nmailing time of the customers is reduced. Customers of a particular region may be \ndirected  to  deposit/remit  their  payments  to  a  collection  center  established  at  the \ncentral place of that region. The collection center will deposit the payments received \nin  the  local  bank  account.  Surplus  (over  the  minimum  balance  to  be  kept)  is \ntransferred to a concentration bank regularly (may be daily), which is generally at the \nfirm's head office. This concentration bank or central bank can get the payments by \ntelegraphic transfer or telex, as per the instructions given by the firm. The collection \ncentres may themselves collect the cheques or the cash payment from the customers, \ninstead  of  customers  remitting  the  payments  to  the collection  center.  It  further \naccelerates the process  of collection because of the reduction in the mailing time. \nThe advantage of system of decentralized collection is two-fold:  \n•    The  mailing  time  is  reduced,  because  the  bills  are  prepared  by  the  local \ncollection centres and sent by them to the customers. Further, if the collection \ncentres  collect  the  payments  by  themselves,  the  time  requires  for  mailing  is \nreduced on this account also.  \n•    Collection  time  is  reduced,  since  the  payments  collected  are  deposited  in  the \nlocal  bank  accounts.  The  funds  become  useable  by  the  firm  immediately  on \nhearing from the collection center about the amount being deposited in the local \nbank account. \n d)  Lock  Box  System:  The  system  is  a  further  improvement  over  the \nconcentration banking system in the matter of accelerating the cash inflows.

Before determining the \ncollection centers, a feasibility study is made of the possibility of cheques that would \nbe deposited under alternative plans.  In this regard operations research  techniques \nnave proved useful in the location of lock box sites. A post office box is hired by the \nfirm  at  each  collection  center  and  the  customers  are  instructed  to  mail  through \nremittances to the box. The remittances are picked up by the local bank directly from \nthe post office box (i.e., lock box) as per the instructions given by the firm. The bank \ncan pick up the mail several times a day and deposit the cheques in the account of the \nfirm. A record is kept by the bank regarding the cheques deposited and is sent to the \nfirm as and when required.  \nThe advantages of such a system are as under: \n •    The cheques are deposited sooner than if they were processed by the firm prior \nto deposit-thus the time lag between the receipt of cheques by the firm and the \nactual deposit thereof at the bank is eliminated.  \n•    The firm is freed from the responsibility of handling and depositing the cheques. \nThe main disadvantages of such a system is the cost involved of making such \narrangements—hiring  post  office  box  and  loading  the  bank  with  additional \nburden of work entail costs and sometimes it may be uneconomical for the firm \nto adopt such a system. \nii)   Controlling Cash Outflows:  \n    Just as the golden rule for controlling cash inflows is accelerate the collections'; \nsimilarly,  the  golden  rule  for  controlling  cash  outflows  is  'slow  down  the \ndisbursements'.

It  the  payments  are  made  weekly  then  this \nperiod can be extended to a month. Secondly, finance manager can plan the issuing \nof salary cheque and their disbursements.  \nc)    Inter-bank Transfer:  \n    An efficient use of cash is also possible by inter-bank transfers. If the company \nhas accounts with more than one bank then amounts can be transferred to the bank \nwhere disbursements are to be made. It will help in avoiding excess amount in one \nbank.  \nd)   Paying the Float:  \n    'Float' is the lag between the time the cheque is written and the time the firm's \nbank receives it. A firm may have less balance in its bank account but the firm may \nissue a cheque to its supplier because the supplier would present the cheque to his \nbank  for  payment  only  when  he  receives  it  after  a  few  days.  Moreover,  after \npresentation to the bank, the bank would send the cheque for collection, which would \nalso  consume  some  time.  The  time  by  which  firm's  bank  receives  the  cheque  for \npayment can be used by the firm for utilizing funds for business purposes and exactly \non  the  time  when  the  payment  has  to  be  made  by  the bank,  the  amount  may  be \ndeposited in the bank by the firm. In case the period of time gap can be accurately \nestimated  by  the  financial  manager,  the  firm  can  certainly  earn  during  the  float \nperiod. However, the game is a risky one and should be played with caution.  \n \n ","metadata":{"source":"C:\\Users\\Vedant\\Documents\\Projects\\JPMC-CFG\\Team-2\\server\\assets\\dataset\\business_finance.pdf","pdf":{"version":"1.10.100","info":{"PDFFormatVersion":"1.4","IsAcroFormPresent":false,"IsXFAPresent":false,"Producer":"iLovePDF","ModDate":"D:20240615143501Z"},"metadata":null,"totalPages":344},"loc":{"pageNumber":149}}}],["6aada38d-7d06-43d8-a697-eaf9339ec3d6",{"pageContent":" \n151\ne)    Avoidance of Early Payments:  \n    One way to delay payments is to avoid early payments. According to the terms \nof credit, a firm is required to make a payment within a stipulated period. It entitles a \nfirm to cash discounts. If, however, payments are delayed beyond the due date, the \ncredit standing may be adversely affected so that the firms would find it difficult to \nsecure trade credit later. But if the firm pays its accounts payable before the due date \nit  has  no  special  advantage.  Thus,  a  firm  would  be well  advised  not  to  make \npayments early that is, before the due date.  \nf)    Centralized Disbursements:  \n    Another  method  to  slow  down  disbursements  is  to  have  centralized \ndisbursements.  All  the  payments  should  be  made  by  the  head  office  from  a \ncentralized disbursement account. Such an arrangement would enable a firm to delay \npayments and conserve cash for several reasons. Firstly, it involves increase in the \ntransit time. The remittance from the head office to the customers in distant places \nwould involve more mailing time than a decentralized payment by the local branch. \nThe second reason for reduction in operating cash requirement is that since the firm \nhas a centralized bank account, a relatively smaller total cash balance will be needed. \nIn the case of a decentralized arrangement, a minimum cash balance will have to be \nmaintained at each branch which will add to a large operating cash balance. Finally, \nschedules can be tightly controlled and disbursements made exactly on the right day. \n4. 2. C.3: Receivables Management \nMeaning and Definition of Credit/Receivables: \n    Credit/Receivables  represent  amounts  owed  to  the  firm  as  a  result  of  sale  of \ngoods or services in the ordinary course of business. These are claims of the firm \nagainst its customers and form part of its current assets. Receivables are also known \nas accounts receivables, trade receivables, customer receivables or book debts. The \nreceivables  are  carried  for  the  customers.  The  period  of  credit  and  extent  of \nreceivables  depends  upon  the  credit  policy  followed  by  the  firm.  The  purpose  of \nmaintaining or investing in receivables is to meet competition, and to increase the \nsales and profits.  \n    According  to  Hampton,  \"Receivables  are  asset  accounts  representing  amount \nowned to firm as a result of sale of goods or services in ordinary course of business\".

Their basic aim is \nto provide facility to customers to allow them a reasonable time in which they can \npay for goods purchased by them.  \n    The investments in receivables involve both benefits and costs. The total cost of \nreceivables  consists  of  cost  of  financing,  which  is  a  factor  of  time,  plus  cost  of \nadministration  plus  cost  of  delinquency  plus  cost  of  default.  However,  the \nreceivables  does  not  result  in  increasing  the  cost only,  rather  they  bring  some \nbenefits  also  to  the  firm.  The  benefits  of  credit/receivables  are  increase  in  sales, \nincrease in profit and even to make extra profit. The extension of trade credit has a \nmajor impact on sales, costs and profitability. Other things being equal, a relatively \nliberal policy and, therefore, higher investments in receivables, will produce larger \nsales. However, costs will be higher with liberal policies than with more stringent \nmeasures.  Therefore,  accounts  receivable  management  should  aim  at  a  trade-off \nbetween profit (benefit) and risk (cost). That is to say, the decision to commit funds \nto receivables (or the decision to grant credit) will be based on a comparison of the \nbenefits and costs involved, while determining the optimum level of receivables. The \ncosts and benefits to be compared are marginal costs and benefits. The firm should \nonly  consider  the  incremental  (additional)  benefits  and  costs  that  result  from  a \nchange in the receivables or trade credit policy.  \nFactors Influencing the Size of Receivables:  \n    Besides sales, a number of other factors also influence the size of receivables. \nThe following factors directly and indirectly affect the size of receivables:  \n    1)  Size  of  Credit  Sales: The volume of credit sales is the first factor which \nincreases or decreases the size of receivables. If a concern sells only on cash basis, as \nin the case of Bata Shoe Company, then there will be no receivables. The higher the \npart of credit sales out of total sales, figures of receivables will also be more or vice \nversa.  \n    2)  Credit Policies: A firm with conservative credit policy will have a low size \nof receivables while a firm with liberal credit policy will be increasing this figure. \nThe vigor with which the concern collects the receivables also affects its receivables. \nIf  collections  are  prompt  then  even  if  credit  is  liberally  extended  the  size  of \nreceivables will remain under control. In case receivables remain outstanding for a \nlonger period, there is always a possibility of bad debts.

The  period  of  credit  allowed  and  rates  of  discount  given  are  linked  with \nreceivables.  If  credit  period  allowed  is  more  than receivables  will  also  be  more. \nSometimes trade policies of competitors have to be followed otherwise it becomes \ndifficult  to  expand  the  sales.  The  trade  terms  once  followed  cannot  be  changed \nwithout adversely affecting sales opportunities.  \n    4)  Expansion  Plans: When a concern wants to expand its activities, it will \nhave to enter new markets. To attract customers, it will give incentives in the form of \ncredit facilities. The periods of credit can be reduced when the firm is able to get \npermanent customers. In the early stages of expansion more credit becomes essential \nand size of receivables will be more.  \n    5)   Relation  with  Profits:  The  credit  policy  is  followed  with  a  view  to \nincrease  sales.  When  sales  increase  beyond  a  certain  level  the  additional  costs \nincurred are less than the increase in revenues. It will be beneficial to increase sales \nbeyond  a  point  because  it  will  bring  more  profits. The  increase  in  profits  will  be \nfollowed by an increase in the size of receivables or vice-versa.  \n    6)  Credit Collection Efforts: The collection of credit should be streamlined. \nThe customers should be sent periodical reminders if they fail to pay in time. On the \nother  hand,  if  adequate  attention  is  not  paid  towards  credit  collection  then  the \nconcern  can  land  itself  in  a  serious  financial  problem.  Efficient  credit  collection \nmachinery  will  reduce  the  size  of  receivables.  If  these  efforts  are  slower  then \noutstanding amounts will be more.  \n    7)  Habits of Customers: The paying habits of customers also have a bearing \non the size of receivables. The customers may be in the habit of delaying payments \neven though they are financially sound. The concern should remain in touch with \nsuch customers and should make them realize the urgency of their needs.  \n    8)  Stability of Sales: In the business of seasonal character, total sales and the \ncredit sales will go up in the season and therefore volume of receivables will also be \nlarge. On the other hand, if a firm supplies goods on installment basis, its balance in \nreceivables will be high.  \n    9)  Size  and  Policy  of  Cash  Discount:  It  is  also  an  important  variable  in \ndeciding  the  level  of  investment  in  receivables.

If cost of capital of the firm is lower in \ncomparison to the cash discount to be allowed, investment in receivables will be less. \nIf both are equal, it will not affect the investment at all. If cost of capital is higher \nthan cash discount, the investment in receivables will be larger.  \n    10)  Bill Discounting and Endorsement: If firm has any arrangement with the \nbanks to get the bills discounted or if they re-endorsed to third parties, the level of \ninvestment in assets will be automatically low. If bills are honored on due dates, the \ninvestment will be larger.  \n    A concern should be clear about its credit policies. How much will be the size of \nreceivables on the basis of present policies? This is an important estimation which \nwill help the concern in planning its working capital. Though it is not possible to \nforecast exact receivables in the future but some estimation is possible on the basis of \npast experience, present credit policies and policies pursued by other concerns. The \nfactors help in forecasting receivables are Credit Period Allowed, Effect of Cost of \nGoods  Sold,  Forecasting  Expenses,  Forecasting  Average  Collection  Period  and \nDiscounts, and Average Size of Receivables etc. \nMeaning of Credit/Receivables Management: \n    Credit/Receivables management is the process of making decisions relating to \ninvestment  in  trade  debtors.  Certain  investment  in receivables  is  necessary  to \nincrease the sales and the profits of a firm. But at the same time investment in this \nasset involves cost considerations also. Further, there is always a risk of bad debts \ntoo. The term Receivables management may be defined as collection of steps and \nprocedure required to properly weigh the costs and benefits attached with the credit \npolicies. The Receivables management consists of matching the cost of increasing \nsales (particularly credit sales) with the benefits arising out of increased sales with \nthe objective of maximizing the return on investment of the firm.  \nObjectives of Credit/Receivables Management: \n    The objectives of credit/receivables management are to improve sales, eliminate \nbad debts, and reduce transaction costs incidental to maintenance of accounts and \ncollection of sale proceeds and, finally, enhance profits of the firm. Credit sales help \nthe organization to make extra profit. It is a known fact; firms charge a higher price, \nwhen sold on credit, compared to normal price.

So,  the  additional  contribution,  totally,  goes  towards \nprofit, improving the profitability of the firm.  \n    2)  Optimum  Level  of  Investment  in  Receivables:  To  support  sales,  it  is \nnecessary for the firm to make investment in receivables. Investment in receivables \ninvolves costs as funds are tied up in debtors. Further, there is also risk in respect of \nbad  debts  too.  On  the  other  hand,  receivables  bring  returns.  If  so,  till  what  level \ninvestment is to be made in receivables? Investment in receivables is to be made till \nthe incremental costs are less than the incremental return.  \n    Thus, the objective of receivables management is to make a sound Investment in \ndebtors. In the words of Bolton, S.E., The objective of receivables management is 'to \npromote sales and profits until that point is reached where the return on investment in \nfurther  funding  receivables  is  less  than  the  cost  of  funds  raised  to  finance  that \nadditional credit (i.e. cost of capital)'. \nDimensions of Credit/Receivables Management: \n    Credit/Receivables  management  involves  the  careful  consideration  of  the \nfollowing aspects:  \n1)   Credit Policy.  \n2)   Credit Evaluation \n3)   Monitoring Receivables  \nThese points are explained below: \n1. Credit Policy: \n    The credit policy of a company can be regarded as a kind of trade-off between \nincreased  credit  sales  leading  to  increase  in  profit  and  the  cost  of  having  larger \namount of cash locked up in the form of receivables and the loss due to the incidence \nof  bad  debts.  In  competitive  market,  the  credit  policy  adopted  by  a  company  is \nconsiderably influenced by the practices followed by the industry.

Further,  other \ncompanies also may have to fall in line in the long run. It is assumed generally that \nsuch factors have already been taken into consideration before making changes in the \ncredit policy of a company.  \nThe credit policy of a firm provides the framework to determine: \n i)   Whether or not to extend credit to a customer and  \nii)   How much credit to extend.  \nThe credit policy decision of firm has following dimensions:  \nA)   Credit Standards  \nB)   Credit Term  \nC)   Collection Efforts.  \nA.   Credit Standards: \n    The term credit standards represent the basic criteria for the extension of credit \nto customers. The quantitative basis of establishing credit standards are factors such \nas  credit  ratings,  credit  references,  average  payments  period  and  certain  financial \nratios.  The  overall  standards  are  divided  into  two categories  as  -  1)  Tight  or \nrestrictive, and 2) Liberal or non-restrictive. \n    The optimum level of investment in receivables should be where there is a trade-\noff between the costs and profitability. The increased investment in receivables also \nadversely  affects  the  liquidity  of  a  firm.  On  the  other  hand,  a  tight  credit  policy \nincreases the liquidity of a firm. Thus, optimum level or investment in receivables is \nachieved at a point where there is a trade-off between cost, profitability and liquidity. \nThe trade-off with reference to credit standards covers Collection Costs, Investments \nin  Receivables  or  the  Average  Collection  Period,Bad  Debt  Expenses,and  Sales \nVolume etc. \n    The  basic  changes  and  effects  on  profits  arising  from  a  relaxation  of  credit \nstandards are summarized in the following table.

Credit Terms  \n    The second decision area in credit policies of firm is the credit terms. After the \ncredit standards have been established and the credit-worthiness of the customers has \nbeen assessed, the management of a firm must determine the terms and conditions on \nwhich trade credit will be made available. The stipulations under which goods are \nsold on credit are referred to as credit terms. These relate to the repayment of the \namount  under  the  credit  sale.  Thus,  credit  terms  specify  the  repayment  terms  of \nreceivables.  \nCredit term has three Components:  \n    1)  Cash Discount Period: The collection of receivables is influenced by the \nperiod  allowed  for  availing  the  discount.  The  additional  period  allowed  for  this \nfacility may prompt some more customers to avail discount and make payments. This \nwill  mean  additional  funds  released  from  receivables  which  may  be  alternatively \nused. At the same time the extending of discount period will result in late collection \nof  funds  because  those  who  were  getting  discount  and  making  payments  as  per \nearlier schedule will also delay their payments.  \n    2)   Cash  Discount:  Cash  discount  is  allowed  to  expedite  the  collection  of \nreceivables. The funds tied up in receivables are released. The concern will be able to \nuse the additional funds received from expedited collections due to cash discount. \nThe  discount  allowed  involves  cost.  The  financial  manager  should  compare  the \nearnings resulting from released funds and tht cost of discount. The discount should \nbe allowed only if its cost is less than the earnings from additional funds.

The implications \nof increasing or initiating cash discount are as follows:  \ni)    The sales volume will increase. The grant of discount implies reduced prices. If \nthe demand for the products is elastic, reduction in prices will result in higher \nsales volume.  \nii)  Since the customers, to take advantage of the discount, would like to pay within \nthe  discount  period,  the  average  collection  period would  be  reduced.  The \nreduction in the collection period would lead to a reduction in the investment in \nreceivables as also the cost. The decrease in the average collection period would \nalso cause a fall in bad debt expenses. As a result, profits would increase.  \niii)   The discount would have a negative effect on the profits. This is because the \ndecrease in prices would affect the profit margin per unit of sale. \n    The effects of increase in the cash discount are summarized in Table below.

There is no hard and fast rule regarding the credit period and it may differ \nfrom one market to another. The credit period generally varies from 3 days to 60 \ndays.  In  some  cases,  the  credit  period  may  be  zero and  only  cash  sale  are  made. \nCustomary  practices  are  important  factor  in  deciding  the  credit  period.

The \neffect of changing the credit period is similar to that of changing the credit standard \nand  hence  requires  careful  analysis.  The  firm  must consider  the  cost  involved  in \nincreasing  the  credit  period  which  will  result  in  increase  in  the  investment  in \nreceivables.  \nThe expected effect of an increase in the credit period is summarized as follows: \nEffect of Increase in Credit Period \nItem Direction of Change \n(I =Increase, D = Decrease) \nEffect on Profits \n(Positive +, Negative -) \nSales Volume I + \nAverage Collection Period I - \nBad Debts I - \nA decrease in credit period will have an opposite effect. \nC. Collection Effort  \n    The third area involved in the credit policy is collection policies. They refer to \nthe procedures followed to collect accounts receivable when, after the expiry of the \ncredit period, they become due. These policies cover two aspects: \n1. Degree of Effort to Collect the Overdue: \n    To show the effects of the collection effort, the credit policies of a firm may be \ncategorized into strict and lenient.  \n    A  strict  policy  of  collection  will  involve  more  efforts  on  collection.  Such  a \npolicy has both plus and negative effects. This policy will enable early collection of \ndues and will reduce bad debt losses.

On  the  other  hand  a  rigorous \ncollection  policy  will  involve  increased  collection  costs.

Types of Collection Effort: \n     The second aspect of collection policies relates to the steps that should be taken \nto collect overdue from the customers. A well-established collection policy should \nhave  clear-cut  guidelines  as  to  the  sequence  of  collection  efforts.  After  the  credit \nperiod is over and payment remains due, the firm should initiate measures to collect \nthem. The effort should in the beginning be polite, but, with the passage of time, it \nshould  gradually  become  strict.  The  steps  usually  taken  are:  1)  Letters,  including \nreminders, to expedite payment; 2) Telephone calls for personal contact; 3) Personal \nvisits; 4) Help of collection agencies; and finally, 5) Legal action.  \n    The firm should take recourse to very stringent measures, like legal action, only \nafter all other avenues have been fully exhausted. They not only involve a cost but \nalso affect the relationship with the customers. The aim should be to collect as early \nas possible; genuine difficulties of the customers should be given due consideration.  \n2. Credit Evaluation  \n    Besides  establishing  credit  standards,  a  firm  should  develop  procedure  for \nevaluating credit applicants. The second aspect of receivables management of a firm \nis  credit  analysis  and  investigation.  Two  basic  steps  are  involved  in  the  credit \ninvestigation process:  ","metadata":{"source":"C:\\Users\\Vedant\\Documents\\Projects\\JPMC-CFG\\Team-2\\server\\assets\\dataset\\business_finance.pdf","pdf":{"version":"1.10.100","info":{"PDFFormatVersion":"1.4","IsAcroFormPresent":false,"IsXFAPresent":false,"Producer":"iLovePDF","ModDate":"D:20240615143501Z"},"metadata":null,"totalPages":344},"loc":{"pageNumber":159}}}],["17e3e23d-315b-4fed-ab8e-3657ad3768a4",{"pageContent":" \n161\n    1) Obtaining Credit Information: The first step in credit analysis is obtaining \ncredit  information  on  which  to  base  the  evaluation of  a  customer.  The  sources  of \ninformation, broadly speaking, are:  \n    i)  Internal: Usually, firms require their customers to fill various forms and \ndocuments giving details about financial operations. They are also required to furnish \ntrade references with whom the firms can novo contacts to judge the suitability of the \ncustomer  for  credit.  This  type  of  information  is  obtained  from  internal  sources  of \ncredit information. Another internal source of credit information is derived from the \nrecords of the firms contemplating an extension of credit. It is likely that a particular \ncustomer/applicant may have enjoyed credit facility in the past. In that case, the firm \nwould have information on the behavior of the applicant(s) in terms of the historical \npayment pattern. This type of information may not be adequate and may, therefore, \nhave to be supplemented by information from other sources. \n    ii)  External: The availability of information from external sources to assess \nthe  credit-worthiness  of  customers  depends  upon  the  development  of  institutional \nfacilities and industry practices. In India, the external sources of credit information \nare not as developed as in the industrially advanced countries of the world depending \nupon  the  availability;  the  following  external  sources  may  be  employed  to  collect \ninformation.  \n    a) Financial  Statements:  One  external  source  of  credit  information  is  the \npublished  financial  statements,  that  is,  the  balance  sheet  and  the  profit  and  loss \naccount. The financial statements contain very useful information. They throw light \non  an  applicant's  financial  viability,  liquidity,  profitability  and  debt  capacity. \nAlthough the financial statements do not directly reveal the past payment record of \nthe applicant, they are very helpful in assessing the overall financial position of a \nfirm, which significantly determines its credit standing.  \n    b) Bank References: Another useful source of credit information is the bank of \nthe firm which is contemplating the extension of credit. The modus operandi here is \nthat the firm's banker collects the necessary information from the applicant's banks. \nAlternatively,  the  applicant  may  be  required  to  ask  his  banker  to  provide  the \nnecessary information either directly to the firm or to its bank.

The well-known 5 C's of Credit.  \n    i)  Character:  The  word  character  as  a  credit  standard  refers  to borrowers' \nhonesty, responsibility, integrity and consistency. These are evidenced in variety of \nways.  For  example,  police  action,  legal  actions  and  complaints  about  a  person's \ncharacter.  \n    ii)  Capacity:  It  refers  to  the  ability  of  the  borrowers  to  pay  their  financial \nobligations.  This  is  determined  by  current  expected  income,  existing  debts  and \nongoing  operating  expenses.  This  type  of  information  is  available  in  current  and \nproforma financial statements.  \n    iii)  Capital: It is the amount of assets that can be liquidated for the payment of \ndebt if all other means of collecting it fail. This cushion of assets is represented by a \nfirm's equity. \n    iv)  Collateral:  Collateral  refers  to  assets  that  are  pledged  for  security  in  a \ncredit transaction.  \n    v)  Conditions:  Conditions  refer  to  economic  factors,  which  are  beyond  the \ncontrol of funds and which affect company's ability to pay debts.  \n    Although  there  are  no  established  procedures  to  analyze  the  information,  the \nfirm should devise one to suit its needs.  \nThe analysis should cover two aspects:  \n    i)  Quantitative: The assessment of the quantitative aspects is based on the \nfactual information available from the financial statements, the past records of the \nfirm, and so on. The first step involved in this type of assessment is to prepare an \naging  schedule  of  the  accounts  payable  of  the  applicant  as  well  as  calculate  the \naverage age of the accounts payable. This exercise will give an insight into the past ","metadata":{"source":"C:\\Users\\Vedant\\Documents\\Projects\\JPMC-CFG\\Team-2\\server\\assets\\dataset\\business_finance.pdf","pdf":{"version":"1.10.100","info":{"PDFFormatVersion":"1.4","IsAcroFormPresent":false,"IsXFAPresent":false,"Producer":"iLovePDF","ModDate":"D:20240615143501Z"},"metadata":null,"totalPages":344},"loc":{"pageNumber":161}}}],["fdd4936f-a18b-4464-9e46-449ebd7ecde2",{"pageContent":" \n163\npayment pattern of the customer. Another step it analyzing the credit information is \nthrough  a  ratio  analysis  of  the  liquidity,  profitability  and  debt  capacity  of  the \napplicant.  These  ratios  should  be  compared  with  the  industry  average.  Moreover, \ntrend  analysis  over  a  period  of  time  would  reveal  the  financial  strength  of  the \ncustomer.  \n    ii)  Qualitative:  The  quantitative  assessment  should  be  supplemented  by  a \nqualitative/subjective  interpretation  of  the  applicant's  credit-worthiness.  The \nsubjective  judgment  would  cover  aspects  relating  to  the  quality  of  management. \nHere,  the  references  from  other  suppliers,  bank  references  and  specialist  bureau \nreports  would  form  the  basis  for  the  conclusions  to  be  drawn.  In  the  ultimate \nanalysis, therefore, the decision whether to extend credit to the applicant and what \namount  to  extend  will  depend  upon  the  subjective  interpretation  of  his  credit \nstanding.  \n3. Monitoring of Receivables  \n    The  next  important  step  in  management  of  receivables  is  control  of  these \nreceivables. Setting of standard and framing the credit policy is not sufficient and \ntheir effective implementation is also equally important.  \n    In order to controls the level of receivable, the firm should apply regular checks \nand there must be continuous monitoring system. The financial manager should keep \na watch on the creditworthiness of all the customers as well as on the total credit \npolicy of the firm. The following methods can be adopted for this purpose: \n    1)  Average Collection Period: The average collection period may be found \nby dividing the average receivables by the amount of credit sales per day. \n Average Collection Period    = \n\u0012\u0013\u0014\u0015\u0016\u0017\u0014\t\u0018\u0014\u0019\u0014\u001a\u0013\u0016\u001b\u001c\u0014\u001d\n\u001e\u0015\u0014\u001f\u001a \t!\u0016\u001c\u0014\u001d\t\"\u0014\u0015\t\u001f\u0016#\n \n    Number of day's sales outstanding may be calculated on a weekly basis. The \nmanagerial efficiency can be ascertained by comparing it with the past year's period \nof the firm.  \n    2)  Aging Schedule of Receivables: The quality of receivables of the firm can \nbe measured by looking at the age of receivables. The older the receivable, lower is \nthe  quality  and  greater  chances  of  default.  In  aging  schedule,  total  outstanding ","metadata":{"source":"C:\\Users\\Vedant\\Documents\\Projects\\JPMC-CFG\\Team-2\\server\\assets\\dataset\\business_finance.pdf","pdf":{"version":"1.10.100","info":{"PDFFormatVersion":"1.4","IsAcroFormPresent":false,"IsXFAPresent":false,"Producer":"iLovePDF","ModDate":"D:20240615143501Z"},"metadata":null,"totalPages":344},"loc":{"pageNumber":162}}}],["9a1a3642-953b-4df3-842b-970d1f334a7f",{"pageContent":" \n164\nreceivables on a particular day are classified into different age groups together with \npercentage of total receivables that fall in each age group.  \n    3)   Line  of  Credit:  This  is  an  another  control  measure  for  receivables \nmanagement which refers to the maximum amount a particular customer may have \nas  due  to  the  firm  at  any  time.  Different  lines  of credit  are  allowed  to  different \ncustomers. As long as the customer's unpaid balance remains within this maximum \nlimit,  account  may  be  routinely  handled.  The  line  of  credit  must  be  reviewed \nperiodically  for  all  the  customers.  This  does  not  mean  that  credit  line  must  be \nchanged, rather it may be unchanged or increased or reduced.  \n    4)  Accounting  Ratios:  They  are  of  good  help  in  order  to  control  the \nreceivables. Though several ratios may be calculated in this regard, two accounting \nratios, in particular, may be used. They are: i) Receivables Turnover Ratio, and ii) \nAverage  Collection  Period.  Both  the  ratios  should  be  calculated  on  a  continuous \nbasis to monitor the receivables.  \n4. 2. C.4: Inventory Management \nMeaning and Definition of Inventory: \n    The dictionary meaning of inventory is 'stock of goods'. The word 'Inventory' is \nunderstood differently by various authors. In accounting language it may mean stock \nof finished goods only. In a manufacturing concern, it may include raw materials, \nwork in process and stores, etc.  \n    International Accounting Standard Committee (I.A.S.C) defines inventories as \n\"Tangible property - 1) Held for sale in the ordinary course of business, 2) In the \nprocess  of  production  for  such  sale  or,  3)  To  be  consumed  in  the  process  of \nproduction of goods or services for sale\".  \n    The American Institute of Certified Public Account (AICPA) defines \"inventory \nin the sense of tangible goods, which are held for sale, in process of production and \navailable for ready consumption.\" \n     According to Bolten S.E., \"Inventory refers to stock-pile of product, a firm is \noffering for sale and components that make up the product\". \n \n ","metadata":{"source":"C:\\Users\\Vedant\\Documents\\Projects\\JPMC-CFG\\Team-2\\server\\assets\\dataset\\business_finance.pdf","pdf":{"version":"1.10.100","info":{"PDFFormatVersion":"1.4","IsAcroFormPresent":false,"IsXFAPresent":false,"Producer":"iLovePDF","ModDate":"D:20240615143501Z"},"metadata":null,"totalPages":344},"loc":{"pageNumber":163}}}],["2fb308ad-5197-4425-ad50-44e8add7096a",{"pageContent":" \n165\nInventory includes the following things:  \n 1)  Raw  Material:  It  includes  direct  material  used  in  the  manufacture  of  a \nproduct. The purpose of holding raw material is to ensure uninterrupted producton in \nthe event of delaying delivery. The amount of raw materials to be kept by a firm \ndepends on various factors such as speed with which raw materials are to be ordered \nand procured and uncertainty in the supply of these raw materials.  \n 2)  Work-in-Progress:  It  includes  partly  finished  goods  and  materials  held \nbetween manufacturing stages. It can also be stated that those raw materials which \nare used in production process but are not finally converted into final product are \nwork-in-progress.  \n 3)  Consumable:  Consumables  are  products  that  consumers  buy  recurrently, \ni.e.,  items  which  \"get  used-up\"  or  discarded.  For  example,  consumable  office \nsupplies are such products as paper, pens, file folders, post-it notes, computer disks, \nand  toner  or  ink  cartridges.  Not  included  capital  goods  such  as  computers,  fax \nmachines, and other business machines or office furniture.  \n 4) Finished Goods: The goods ready for sale or distribution comes under this \nclass. It helps to reduce the risk associated with stoppage in output on account of \nstrikes, breakdowns, shortage of material, etc.  \n 5)  Stores  and  Spares:  This  category  includes  those  products,  which  are \naccessories  to  the  main  products  produced  for  the  purpose  of  sale.  For  example, \nstores  and  spares  items  are  bolts,  nuts,  clamps,  screws,  etc.  These  spare  parts  are \nusually  bought  from  outside  or  sometimes  they  are  manufactured  in  the  company \nalso.  \n    Each  firm  hold  inventory  for  one  or  another  purpose.  There  are  three  main \npurposes  or  motives  of  holding  inventories.  These  are  Transaction  Motive, \nPrecautionary  Motive,  and  Speculative  Motive.    Every  firm  has  to  maintain  some \nlevel of inventory to meet the day to day requirements of sales, production process, \ncustomer demand etc. It is called as transaction motive. A firm should keep some \ninventory for unforeseen circumstances also. It is a precautionary motive. The firm \nmay be tempted to keep some inventory in order to capitalize an opportunity to make \nprofit e.g., sufficient level of inventory may help the firm to earn extra profit in case \nof expected shortage in the market, it is a speculative motive.

The amount of investment is sometimes \nmore in inventory than  in other assets. About 90 per cent part of working  capital \ninvested in inventories. It is necessary for every management to give proper attention \nto inventory management. A proper planning of purchasing, handling,  storing and \naccounting  should  form  a  part  of  inventory  management.  An  efficient  system  of \ninventory  management  will  determine  (a)  what  to  purchase  (b)  how  much  to \npurchase (c) from where to purchase (d) where to store, etc.  \n    The purpose of inventory management is to keep the stocks in neither a way that \nthere is over-stocking nor under-stocking. The over-stocking will mean reduction of \nliquidity  and  starving  of  other  production  processes;  under-stocking,  on  the  other \nhand, will result in stoppage of work. The investments in inventory should keep in \nreasonable limits.  \nObjective of Inventory Management: \nThe objectives of inventory management may be discussed under two heads:  \n1)   Operating Objectives:  \n    Operational objectives refer to material and other parts which are available in \nsufficient quantity. It includes - \n  i)  Availability  of  Materials:  The  first  and  the  foremost  objective  of  the \ninventory  management  is  to  make  all  types  of  materials  available  at  all  times \nwhenever they are needed by the production departments so that the production may \nnot be held up for want of materials. It is therefore advisable to maintain a minimum \nquantity of all types of materials to move on the production on schedule. \n ii)  Minimizing  the  Wastage:    Inventory  control  is  essential  to  minimize  the \nwastage at all levels i.e. during its storage in the godown or at work in the factory. \nNormal wastage, in other words uncontrollable wastage, should only be permitted. \nAny  abnormal  but  controllable  wastage  should  strictly  be  controlled.  Wastage  of \nmaterials  by  leakage,  theft,  embezzlement  and  spoilage  due  to  rust,  dust  or  dirt \nshould be avoided.

It reduces wastage and cost of production \nand improves the morale of workers.  \n iv) Better Service to Customers: In order to meet the demand of the customers, \nit is the responsibility of the concern to produce sufficient stock of finished goods to \nexecute the orders received. It means, a flow of production should be maintained.  \n v)  Control  of  Production  Level:  The  concern  may  decide  to  increase  or \ndecrease the production level in favorable time and the inventory may be controlled \naccordingly. But in odd times, when raw materials are in short supply. Proper control \nof inventory helps in creating and maintaining buffer stock to meet any eventuality. \nProduction variations can also be avoided through proper control to inventories.  \n vi)  Optimal  Level  of  Inventories:  Proper  control  of  inventories  helps \nmanagement to procure materials in time in order to run the plan efficiently. It thus, \nhelps  in  the  maintaining  the  optimum  level  of  inventories  keeping  in  view  the \noperational requirements. It also avoids the out of stock danger.  \n2)   Financial Objectives:  \n    The financial objectives means that investment in inventories must not remain \nidle and minimum capital must be locked in it. It includes - \n i) Economy in Purchasing: Proper inventory control brings certain advantages \nand economies in purchasing the raw materials. Management makes every attempt to \npurchase  the  raw  materials  in  bulk  quantity  and  to take  advantage  of  favorable \nmarket conditions.  \n ii) Optimum Investment and Efficient Use of Capital: The prime objective of \ninventory  control  from  financial  point  of  view  is  to  have  an  optimum  level  of \ninvestment in inventories. There should neither  be any deficiency of stock of raw \nmaterials so as to hold up the production process nor there any excessive investment \nin inventories so as to block the capital that could be used in an efficient manner \notherwise. It is, therefore, the responsibility of financial management to set up the \nmaximum  and  minimum  levels  of  stocks  to  avoid  deficiency  or  surplus  stock \npositions.

It  helps  in \ncontrolling  the  cost  of  production  and  the  quality of  finished  goods  in  order  to \nmaximize the profits of the concern.  \n iv)  Minimizing  Costs: Minimizing inventory costs such as handling, ordering \nand  carrying  costs,  etc.,  is  one  of  the  main  objectives  of  inventory  management. \nFinancial  management  should  help  controlling  the  inventory  costs  in  a  way  that \nreduces the cost per unit of inventory. Inventory costs are the part of total cost of \nproduction  hence  cost  of  production  can  also  a  minimized  by  controlling  the \ninventory costs. \nTools and Techniques of Inventory Management: \n    Effective  inventory  management  requires  an  effective  control  system  for \ninventories. A proper inventory control not only helps in solving the acute problem \nof liquidity but also increases profits and causes substantial reduction in the working \ncapital of the concern.  \n    The following are the important tools and techniques of inventory management \nand control:  \n1)   Determination of Stock Levels  \n2)   Determination of safety stocks  \n3)   Ordering System of Inventory  \n4)   Determination of Economic Order Quantity  \n5)   JIT Analysis  \n6)   A-B-C Analysis  \n7)   VED Analysis  \n8)   Inventory Turnover Ratio  \n9)   Aging Schedule of Inventories  \n10)  Perpetual inventory system  \n    Some of the above techniques of inventory management are explained below in \nshort.

If \nthe inventory level is too little, the firm will face frequent stock-outs involving heavy \nordering cost and if the inventory level is too high it will be unnecessary tie-up of \ncapital.  Therefore,  an  efficient  inventory  management  requires  that  a  firm  should \nmaintain an optimum level of inventory where inventory costs are the minimum and \nat the same time there is no stock-out which may result in loss of sale of stoppage of \nproduction. The various stock levels are as Minimum Stock Level, Maximum Stock \nLevel, Re-ordering Level, Danger Level and Average Stock Level etc. \n2) Determination of Safety Stocks:  \n    Safety stock is a buffer to meet some unanticipated increase in usage. The usage \nof inventory cannot be perfectly forecasted. It fluctuates over a period of time. The \ndemand for materials may fluctuate and delivery of inventory may also be delayed \nand in such a situation the firm can face a problem of stock-out. The stock out can \nprove  costly  by  affecting  the  smooth  working  of  the  concern.  In  order  to  protect \nagainst the stock out arising out of usage fluctuations, firms usually maintain some \nmargin of safety stocks. The basic problem is to determine the level of quantity of \nsafety  stocks.  Two  costs  are  involved  in  the  determination  of  this  stock  i.e. \nopportunity cost of stock-outs and the carrying costs. The stock-outs of raw materials \ncause production disruption resulting into higher cost of production. Similarly, the \nstock-outs of finished goods result into the failure of the firm in competition as the \nfirm cannot provide proper customer service. If a firm maintains low level of safety \nfrequent stock-outs will occur resulting into the larger opportunity costs. On the other \nhand, the larger quantities of safety stocks involve higher carrying costs.  \n3) Ordering Systems of Inventory:  \n    The  basic  problem  of  inventory  is  to  decide  the  re-order  point.  This  point \nindicates when an order should be placed. There-order point is determined with the \nhelp of (a) average consumption rate, (b) duration of lead time, (c) economic order \nquantity, when the inventory is depleted to lead time consumption, the order should \nbe placed. There are three prevalent systems of ordering and a concern can choose \nany one these:  ","metadata":{"source":"C:\\Users\\Vedant\\Documents\\Projects\\JPMC-CFG\\Team-2\\server\\assets\\dataset\\business_finance.pdf","pdf":{"version":"1.10.100","info":{"PDFFormatVersion":"1.4","IsAcroFormPresent":false,"IsXFAPresent":false,"Producer":"iLovePDF","ModDate":"D:20240615143501Z"},"metadata":null,"totalPages":344},"loc":{"pageNumber":168}}}],["a036e744-3bbc-442a-bded-59184f27cde6",{"pageContent":" \n170\n i) Fixed Order Quantity System (or Q System): Under this system, materials \nare reordered at irregular intervals whenever the stock reaches the reorder level. The \nreorder  quantity  is  normally  the  economic  ordering quantity  so  that  the  aggregate \nordering  costs  and  stock  holding  costs  are  the  lowest.  In  this  system  the  order \nquantity is fixed but the order period varies.  \n ii) Periodic Review System (or P System): Under this P system, the economic \nordering quantity is converted into a time scale, and this period is known as periodic \nreview  time  or  cycle  time.  The  period  between  the  placements  of  orders  is  fixed, \nwhile  the  quantity  ordered  varies.  The  average  inventory  held  in  the  P  system  is \ngreater than that held in the Q system. But the great advantage in P system lies in \nreduction or monitoring labor and launching of orders. In P system, the buffer stock \nindicates  the  average  consumption  during  lead  time and  review  time.  The  safety \nstock is the same as in the Q system to denote increased consumption as a result of \npossible  extension  of  lead  time.  The  reserved  stock  is  calculated  on  the  basis  of \nexcess consumption during lead time and review time. \n iii)  Modified  Replenishment  System:  Under  this  system  reorder  quantity  is \nvariable  like  the  P  system  but  lower  limit  is  placed  on  its  size,  i.e.,  reordering \nquantity should not be below the fixed lower limit when the order is placed at a fixed \nperiod  to  time.  This  system  combines  the  main  features  of  the  other  two  systems \nnamely, maximum level, a variable order quantity subject to a certain lower limit, a \nreordering level and review of the level at a fixed interval.  \n4)   Economic Order Quantity (EOQ):  \n    EOQ  is  an  important  factor  in  controlling  the  inventory.  It  is  a  quantity  of \ninventory which can reasonably be ordered economically at a time. It is also known \nas  'Standard  Order  Quantity',  'Economic  Lot  Size,' or  'Economical  Ordering \nQuantity'. In determining this point ordering costs and carrying costs are taken into \nconsideration. Ordering costs are basically the cost of getting an item of inventory \nand  it  includes  cost  of  placing  an  order.  Carrying cost  includes  costs  of  storage \nfacilities, property insurance, and loss of value through physical deterioration, cost of \nobsolescence. Either of these two costs affects the profits of the firm adversely and \nmanagement tries to balance these two costs. The balancing or reconciliation point is \nknown as economic order quantity.  \nThe quantity may be calculated with the help of the following formula: ","metadata":{"source":"C:\\Users\\Vedant\\Documents\\Projects\\JPMC-CFG\\Team-2\\server\\assets\\dataset\\business_finance.pdf","pdf":{"version":"1.10.100","info":{"PDFFormatVersion":"1.4","IsAcroFormPresent":false,"IsXFAPresent":false,"Producer":"iLovePDF","ModDate":"D:20240615143501Z"},"metadata":null,"totalPages":344},"loc":{"pageNumber":169}}}],["276c9acb-ca46-4693-a59c-b7672e19f58c",{"pageContent":" \n171\nEOQ =\t\n\u0001\n\u0002$%\n&\n \nWhere, A = Annual quantity used (in units) \n S = Cost of placing an order (fixed cost)  \n I = Cost of holding one unit.  \n5)   Just-In-Time (JIT):  \n    Just-In-Time  (JIT)  is  defined  in  the  APICS  dictionary  as  \"a  philosophy  of \nmanufacturing  based  on  planned  elimination  of  all  waste  and  on  continuous \nimprovement of productivity\".  It also has been  described  as an approach with the \nobjective  of  producing  the  right  part  in  the  right place  at  the  right  time  (in  other \nwords, \"just-in-time\"). Waste results from any activity that adds cost without adding \nvalue,  such  as  the  unnecessary  moving  of  materials,  the  accumulation  of  excess \ninventory,  or  the  use  of  faulty  production  methods that  create  products  requiring \nsubsequent  rework.  JIT  (also  known  as  lean  production  or  stockless  production) \nshould  improve  profits  and  return  on  investment  by reducing  inventory  levels \n(increasing  the  inventory  turnover  rate),  reducing variability,  improving  product \nquality, reducing production and delivery lead times, and reducing other costs (such \nas those associated with machine setup and equipment breakdown). In a JIT system, \nunderutilized (excess) capacity is used instead of buffer inventories to hedge against \nproblems that may arise. JIT applies primarily to repetitive manufacturing processes \nin which the same products and components are produced over and over again. The \ngeneral idea is to establish flow processes (even when the facility uses a jobbing or \nbatch process layout) by linking work centers so that there is an even, balanced flow \nof  materials  throughout  the  entire  production  process,  similar  to  that  found  in  an \nassembly line. To accomplish this, an attempt is made to reach the goals of driving \nall inventory buffers toward zero and achieving the ideal lot size of one unit. The \nmain advantages of JIT system are as - i) Increased awareness of different problems \nand their costs, ii) Reducing lot size and less work in progress, iii) Less raw material \ninventory, less indirect material and less finished goods, iv) Higher productivity, v) \nFaster feedback of defects, vi) Reduced material inventory as well as material waste, \nvii)  High  quality  of  finished  goods  and  smoother  output,  viii)  Better  control  over \ndefects and improved overall working etc. ","metadata":{"source":"C:\\Users\\Vedant\\Documents\\Projects\\JPMC-CFG\\Team-2\\server\\assets\\dataset\\business_finance.pdf","pdf":{"version":"1.10.100","info":{"PDFFormatVersion":"1.4","IsAcroFormPresent":false,"IsXFAPresent":false,"Producer":"iLovePDF","ModDate":"D:20240615143501Z"},"metadata":null,"totalPages":344},"loc":{"pageNumber":170}}}],["a4b76bff-c4b3-43f7-90bb-dc251fae69ba",{"pageContent":" \n172\n6)   A-B-C Analysis:  \n    The materials are divided into a number of categories for adopting a selective \napproach for material control. It is generally seen that in manufacturing concern, a \nsmall percentage of items contribute a large percentage of value of consumption and \na large percentage of items of materials contribute a small percentage of value. In \nbetween these two limits there are some items which have almost equal percentage of \nvalue  of  materials.  Under  A-B-C  analysis,  the  materials  are  divided  into  three \ncategories viz., A, B and C.

About 20 per cent of the items contribute about 20 per cent of value of \nconsumption and this is known as category 'B' materials. Category 'C' covers about \n70  per  cent  of  items  of  materials  which  contribute only  10  per  cent  of  value  of \nconsumption.  There  may  be  some  variation  in  different  organization  and  an \nadjustment can be made in these percentages.  \n    A-B-C analysis helps to concentrate more efforts on category A since greatest \nmonetary  advantage  will  come  by  controlling  these  items.  An  attention  should  be \npaid in estimating requirements, purchasing, maintaining safety stocks and properly \nstoring of 'A' category materials. These items are kept under a constant review so that \na substantial material cost may be controlled. The control of 'C' items may be relaxed \nand these stocks may be purchased for the  year.

That means without working capital the working of the business cannot be \npossible.  Working  capital  is  called  as  the  life  blood  or  heart  of  the  business. \nImportance of working capital in the business explains the need of working capital \nmanagement. The most widely used concept of working capital is defined as, \"the \ndifference between current assets and current liabilities.\" This concept is useful to \nknow the liquidity of the firm. There are different concepts/types of working capital \nhaving  different  meanings  such  as  Gross  Working  Capital,  Net  Working  Capital, \nNegative Working Capital, Permanent Working Capital, Variable Working Capital, \nand Cash Working Capital. Working capital finance generally refers to debt raised \nfor a period of less than a year from Term Lending Institutions, Commercial Banks \nand  Non-Banking  Finance  Companies  (NBFC)  catering  to  the  short-term  credit \nneeds of the business entities. Working capital finance may be fund-based or through \nnon-fund based or documentary credit instruments. \n    Working capital, in general practice, refers to the excess of current assets over \ncurrent liabilities. Management of working capital therefore, is concerned with the \nproblems that arise in attempting to manage the current assets, the current liabilities \nand  the  inter-relationship  that  exists  between  them.  In  other  words  it  refers  to  all \naspects  of  administration  of  both  current  assets  and  current  liabilities.  Cash \nmanagement refers to management of cash balance and the bank balance including \nthe short terms deposits. For cash management purposes, the term cash is used in this \nbroader  sense,  i.e.,  it  covers  cash,  cash  equivalents  and  those  assets  which  are \nimmediately convertible into cash. A financial  manager is required to  manage the \ncash  flows  (both  inflows  and  outflows)  arising  out of  the  operations  of  the  firm. \nLiquidity  Management  is  the  management  who  looks  after  to  maintain  the  sound \nliquidity  position  of  the  firm.  Credit/Receivables management  is  the  process  of \nmaking  decisions  relating  to  investment  in  trade  debtors.  Certain  investment  in \nreceivables is necessary to increase the sales and the profits of a firm. But at the same \ntime  investment  in  this  asset  involves  cost  considerations  also.  Further,  there  is \nalways a risk of bad debts too. The Receivables management consists of matching \nthe cost of increasing sales (particularly credit sales) with the benefits arising out of \nincreased  sales  with  the  objective  of  maximizing  the  return  on  investment  of  the ","metadata":{"source":"C:\\Users\\Vedant\\Documents\\Projects\\JPMC-CFG\\Team-2\\server\\assets\\dataset\\business_finance.pdf","pdf":{"version":"1.10.100","info":{"PDFFormatVersion":"1.4","IsAcroFormPresent":false,"IsXFAPresent":false,"Producer":"iLovePDF","ModDate":"D:20240615143501Z"},"metadata":null,"totalPages":344},"loc":{"pageNumber":172}}}],["57f9c60f-f616-4420-badd-8591bcc36cc5",{"pageContent":" \n174\nfirm.

When the amount saved is small, the individual may \nkeep it in the form of cash with himself. But as the savings increases, he/she may \ninvest  in  banks  to  earn  more  rate  of  interest,  or  contribute  to  a  provident  fund \naccount.  Further  if  the  savings  are  substantial  he/she  may  think  of  investing  in \nphysical assets or financial assets. Investing in physical assets refer to investing the \nsurplus  funds  in  land,  building,  gold,  silver,  precious  stones  etc.  Investment  in \nfinancial assets means investing the surplus funds in financial securities such as \nshares,  bonds  and  debentures,  saving  certificates, fixed  deposits  etc.  While \ninvesting  the  surplus  or  savings  an  individual  investor  always  considers  five \nimportant factors. They are safety, liquidity, yield, tax benefit and the convenience. \nSafety refers to minimum risk of losing the money invested, liquidity refers to ease \nin converting physical or financial assets into ready cash, yield refers to the rate of \nreturn on investment made. Tax benefit refers to the getting some tax relief benefit \nwhich accrues to the investors when investment is made in certain securities and \nconvenience  refers  to  ease  with  which  surplus  can  be  invested,  marketed  and \naccounted.  Though  investment  in  physical  assets  offer  highest  safety  to  the \ninvestment, financial assets offer better liquidity and also yield. The investor who \nwants to invest in financial assets can purchase the asset from the capital market.        \n        Capital  market  is  one  of  the  significant  aspects  of  every  financial  market. \nBroadly speaking the capital market is a market for financial assets which have a \nlong or indefinite maturity.

These markets play a vital role in channelizing the \nsavings of individuals for investment in the economic development of the country. \nIn  modern  capital  markets  are  almost  invariably  hosted  on  computer@based \nelectronic trading systems. There are more than thousands of such systems, most \nserving only small parts of the overall capital markets. Entities hosting the systems \ninclude stock exchanges, investment banks, and government departments.  \n         Capital  market  can  be  classified  into  primary  and  secondary  markets.

Private Placement: \n    Private  placement  is  very  suitable,  convenient  method  for  small  issues \nparticularly  during  depression.  Under  this  method, the  issuing  company  sells  its \nsecurities privately to one or more institutional brokers who in turn sell them to \ntheir clients and associates. Moreover, the company gets the money quickly and \nthere  is  no  risk  of  non@receipt  of  minimum  subscription.  However  it  has  some \ndrawbacks that, institutional brokers insist a huge discount or other conditions for \nprivate purchase of securities. Secondly, it may not sell the securities in the market \nbut keep them with it. \n3.   Offer for Sale: \n    Under this method, the issuing company allots the security to an issue house at \nan agreed price. It saves the company from the cost and trouble of selling securities \ndirectly to the investing public. The issue house or financial institution publishes a \ndocument called an ‘offer for sale’. It offers to the public shares or debentures for \nsale  at  higher  price.  After  receiving  applications,  the  issue  house  renounces  the \nallotment in favour of the applicants who become direct allottees of the shares or \ndebentures.  \n4.   Sale through Intermediaries: \n    In  this  process,  company  appoints  intermediaries  like  stock  brokers, \ncommercial  banks  and  financial  institutions  to  assist  in  marketing  for  the  new \nsecurities on commission basis. The company provides blank application forms to \nevery  mediator  who  affixes  his  seal  on  them  and  distributes  among  proposed \ninvestors. Each mediator gets commission on the amount of security applications \nbearing his seal. However, mediators do not guarantee the sale of securities.

Sale to Inside Coterie: \n    A  company  may  resort  to  subscription  by  promoters and  directors.  This \nmethod helps to save the expenses of public issue.

These  services  are  provided  by  some  financial \ninstitutions,  such  as  banks,  insurance  or  investment  houses,  whereby  they \nguarantee  payment  in  case  of  damage  or  financial  loss  and  accept  the  financial \nrisk for liability arising from such guarantee. An underwriting arrangement may be \ncreated in a number of situations including insurance, issue of securities in primary \nmarkets, and in bank lending, among others. \n          The underwriting standards in place help to set benchmarks for how much \ndebt may be issued to a person, the terms of the loans, how much debt a specific \ncompany is willing to issue, and what interest rates will be charged. A securities \nunderwriter  or  investment  bank  is  the  entity  that  helps  corporation  raise  money \nfrom investors. Most of the companies are not set up to manage the sale and then \ndisbursal  of  many  of  their  investment  securities.  Selling  stocks,  bonds  or  other \nsecurities is also an expensive proposition and companies frequently look for ways \nto  reduce  costs  as  well  as  their  risks  when  doing  so.  A  securities  underwriter \nrelieves a client corporation of much of the risk attached to selling its securities. \nThis is a way of distributing a newly issued security, such as stocks or bonds to \ninvestors.  A  lead  banks  manager  underwrites  the  transaction,  which  means  they \nhave taken on the risk of distributing the securities. Should they not be able to find \nenough investors, they will have to hold some securities themselves. Underwriters \nmake their income from the price difference (the underwriting spread) between the \nprice  they  pay  the  issuer  and  what  they  collect  from  investors  or  from  broker@\ndealers who buy portions of the offering. \n1.2.2  Secondary Capital Market (Stock Exchange) \n    The  secondary  market  is  a  pre@requisite  market  for  developing  a  capital \nmarket.  This  market  facilitates  marketability  and  liquidity  of  the  corporate \nsecurities.    Without  this  market,  the  corporate  sector  cannot  grow.  It  is  the \neconomic barometer of the country. It indicates the economic growth of the nation. \nIt  facilitates  the  flow  of  capital  into  profitable enterprises.

They  did  not  exist  in  the ancient  times.  The  growth  of \nstock exchange has been linked with the growth of joint stock companies. The joint \nstock  companies  were,  in  fact,  born  after  the  industrial  revolution.  The  stock \nexchanges  were  born  with  the  birth  of  joint  stock  companies.  So  the  stock \nexchanges were the products of joint stock companies. \n       The first organized stock exchange in India was started in Mumbai (Bombay \nStock  Exchange)  in  1875  with  the  formation  of  the  ‘Native  Share  and  Stock ","metadata":{"source":"C:\\Users\\Vedant\\Documents\\Projects\\JPMC-CFG\\Team-2\\server\\assets\\dataset\\business_finance.pdf","pdf":{"version":"1.10.100","info":{"PDFFormatVersion":"1.4","IsAcroFormPresent":false,"IsXFAPresent":false,"Producer":"iLovePDF","ModDate":"D:20240615143501Z"},"metadata":null,"totalPages":344},"loc":{"pageNumber":192}}}],["def53f2b-e08d-4ed7-be46-c0df4a7424d2",{"pageContent":" \n194\nBrokers Association.

Certain  legal  formalities  have  to  be  followed  to  become  the \nmember of the exchange. There is uniformity of dealings on all stock exchanges. \nThree  types  of  trading  takes  place  in  the  exchanges.  Such  as  (i)  Spot  delivery \ncontract (ii) Ready delivery contract and (iii) Forward delivery contract.    \n        The person who wants to buy or sell the securities cannot directly deal on the \nexchange. He has to select a broker (member) for opening an account and enter \ninto contract for settling the deal. The intending buyer or seller should place an \norder  with  the  broker.

It is focused on communicating to \nthe investors, the relative ranking of the default loss probability for a given fixed \nincome investment in comparison with other rated instruments. \n    According  to  the–Standard  &  Poor’s  “In  determining  a  rating  both \nquantitative and qualitative analysis are employed. The judgement is qualitative in \nnature and the role of the quantitative analysis is to help make the best possible \noverall qualitative judgement because, ultimately, a rating is an opinion”  \n       A rating is specific to a debt instrument and is intended as a grade, an analysis \nof  the  credit  risk  associated  with  the  particular  instrument.  It  is  based  upon  the \nrelative capability and willingness of the issuer of the instrument to service the debt \nobligations (both principal and interest) as per the terms of the contract. Thus, a \nrating  is  neither  a  general  purpose  evaluation  on  the  issuer,  nor  an  overall \nassessment of the credit risk likely to be involved in all the debts contracted or to \nbe contracted by such entity. The primary objective of rating is to provide guidance \nto investor/ creditors in determining a credit risk associated with a debt instrument/ \ncredit obligation. It does not amount to a recommendation to buy, hold or sell an \ninstrument  as  it  does  not  take  into  consideration  factors  such  as  market  prices, \npersonal  risk  preferences  and  other  consideration  which  may  influence  an \ninvestment  decision.  The  rating  process  is  itself  based  on  certain  ‘givens’  the \nagency  for instance does not perform an  audit.  Instead, it is required to rely on \ninformation provided by the issuer and collected by analysts from different source, \nincluding  interactions  in  person  with  various  entities.

The trading in \nphysical  segment  is  full  of  inefficiencies  due  to  handling  of  large  volumes  of \ncertificates  and  also  involves  various  problems.  Depository  system  has  been \nintroduced in India where the securities could be handled in an electronic form by \nthe process of dematerialization. After introduced the Dematerialization in 1996, \nthat  entire  process  was  digitized  and  shares  were  transferred  electronically  in \n“Demat Account“. This depository bought in solutions for all these problems. A \nmajor development has been the setting up of depository services. The objective of \na depository is to provide for the maintenance or transfer of ownership records of \nsecurities  in  an  electronic  form  and  scripless  trading  in  the  stock  exchanges, \nthereby  reducing  settlement  risks.  The  Securities  and  Exchange  Board  of  India \n(SEBI) has granted registration for two depositories in India which are well known \nas NSDL (National securities depository limited) and CDSL (Central Depository \nServices (India) Limited) under the Depository Act, 1996. They interface with the \ninvestors through their agents called Depository participants (DPs). DPs could be \nthe banks (private, public and foreign), financial institutions and SEBI registered \ntrading members. There are mainly three parties involved in Depository System: \n\u0001 Depository: facilitates  the  smooth  flow  of  trading  and  ensure  the  investor`s \nabout their investment in securities \n\u0001 Depository Participant (DP): provides the service of opening a demat account \nto the investor. \n\u0001 Investor: individual or group invested in securities \n    Depository participant provides the service of opening a demat account to the \ninvestor; they are coming with different schemes like three@in@one demat account, \nfree  demat  account  etc  to  attract  the  investors  to open  an  account  with  them. \nHowever,  they  are  making  an  investment  in  to  securities  more  accessible  by \nproviding  services  like  SMS,  e@mail  for  every  transaction,  E@trading  platform, \ninvestment advice etc.  \n    In  India,  Depository  Participant is  described  as  an  agent of  the  depository. \nThey are the mediators between the depository and the investors.

As per the Act, a Depository Participant can offer depository@related \nservices only after obtaining a certificate of registration from SEBI. As of 2012, \nthere were 288 of NSDL and 563 of CDSL registered Depository Participants with \nSEBI. As per the SEBI Regulations 1996, prescribe a minimum net worth of Rs. 50 \nlakh  for  stockbrokers,  agents  and  non@banking  finance  companies  (NBFC),  for \ngranting  them  a  certificate  of  registration  to  act as  Depository  Participants.  If  a \nstockbroker seeks to act as a Depository Participants  in more than one depository, \nhe should comply with the specified net worth criterion separately for each such \ndepository.  \n    Thus, in the depository system, share certificates belonging to the investors are \ndematerialized  and  their  names  are  entered  in  the  records  of  depositary  as \nbeneficial owners. Investors’ names in the companies register are replaced by the \nname of depository as the registered owner of the securities. The beneficial owner \ncontinues to enjoy all the rights and benefits and be subject to all the liabilities in \nrespect  of  the  securities  held  by  the  depository.  The  ownership  changes  in,  the \ndepositary  are  done  automatically  on  the  basis  of  delivery  vs.  payment.  The \ninvestors opting to join depository mode are required to enter into agreement with \ndepository through a participant who acts as an agent of depository. The agencies \nsuch  as  custodians,  bank,  financial  institutions,  large  corporate  brokerage  firms, \nnon@banking  financial  companies  etc.  act  as  participants  of  depositaries.  The \ncompanies issuing securities are also required to enter into an agreement with the \ndepositary. \n1.2.4.6 Form of Depository in India: \n    A  depository  is  an  organization  that  holds  securities  of  investors  in  an \nelectronic  format  at  the  request  of  an  investor  through  a  registered  Depository \nParticipant.

Some of the prominent banks in the country have taken a \nstake in NSDL i.e. State Bank of India, HDFC Bank Limited, Deutsche Bank A.G, \nAxis Bank Limited, Citibank, Oriental Bank of Commerce, Union Bank of India, \nDena  Bank,  Canara  Bank  etc.  It  has  established  in  August  1996  and  actual \noperation  was  commenced  in  October  1996.  The  Depositories  Act  has  provided \ndematerialization route to book entry based transfer of securities and settlement of \nsecurities trade. In exercise of the rights conferred by the Depositories Act, NSDL \nframed its Bye laws and business rules with the approved by SEBI. While the Bye \nLaws define the scope of the functioning of NSDL and its business partners; the \nBusiness Rules outline the operational procedures to be followed by NSDL and its \nBusiness Partners.        \n         NSDL  depository  has  promoted  by  institutions  of  national  importance \nresponsible for economic development of the country.

According  to  the  above \ndefinition, a mutual fund in India can raise resources through sale of units to the \npublic. It can be set up in the form of a Trust under the Indian Trust Act. The \ndefinition has been further extended by allowing mutual funds to diversify their \nactivities in the following areas: Portfolio management services, Management of \noffshore  funds,  Providing  advice  to  offshore  funds,  Management  of  pension  or \nprovident  funds,  Management  of  venture  capital  funds,  Management  of  money \nmarket funds, Management of real estate funds.

Thus,  a  mutual  fund  is  akin  to  portfolio  management  services \n(PMS). Although, both are conceptually same, they are different from each other. \nPortfolio management services are offered to high net worth individuals; taking into \naccount their risk profile, their investments are managed separately. In the case of \nmutual funds, savings of small investors are pooled under a scheme and the returns \nare distributed in the same proportion in which the investments are made by the \ninvestors/unit$holders. Mutual fund is a collective savings scheme. Mutual funds \nplay an important role in mobilising the savings of small investors and channelising \nthe same for productive ventures in the Indian economy. Benefits of Mutual Funds \nAn  investor  can  invest  directly  in  individual  securities  or  indirectly  through  a \nfinancial intermediary. Globally, mutual funds have established themselves as the \nmeans of investment for the retail investor.  \n    1.  Professional  management:  An  average  investor  lacks  the  knowledge  of \ncapital market operations and does not have large resources to reap the benefits of \ninvestment. Hence, he requires the help of an expert. It, is not only expensive to ‘hire \nthe services’ of an expert but it is more difficult to identify a real expert. Mutual \nfunds  are  managed  by  professional  managers  who  have  the  requisite  skills  and \nexperience  to  analyse  the  performance  and  prospects  of  companies.  They  make \npossible an organised investment strategy, which is hardly possible for an individual \ninvestor.  \n 2.  Portfolio  diversification: An investor undertakes risk if he invests all his \nfunds in a single scrip. Mutual funds invest in a number of companies across various \nindustries and sectors. This diversification reduces the riskiness of the investments.  \n 3. Reduction in transaction costs: Compared to direct investing in the capital \nmarket, investing through the funds is relatively less expensive as the benefit of \neconomies of scale is passed on to the investors.  \n 4.  Liquidity: Often, investors cannot sell the securities held easily, while in \ncase of mutual funds, they can easily encash their investment by selling their units to \nthe fund if it is an open$ended scheme or selling them on a stock exchange if it is a \nclose$ended scheme.

Convenience: Investing in mutual fund reduces paperwork, saves time and \nmakes investment easy. \n 6.   Flexibility: Mutual funds offer a family of schemes, and investors have the \noption of transferring their holdings from one scheme to the other.  \n   7. Tax benefits Mutual fund investors now enjoy income$tax benefits. Dividends \nreceived from mutual funds’ debt schemes are tax exempt to the overall limit of Rs \n9,000 allowed under section 80L of the Income Tax Act. \n   8. Transparency Mutual funds transparently declare their portfolio every month. \nThus an investor knows where his/her money is being deployed and in case they are \nnot happy with the portfolio they can withdraw at a short notice. \n   9. Stability to the stock market Mutual funds have a large amount of funds \nwhich provide them economies of scale by which they can absorb any losses in the \nstock market and continue investing in the stock market. In addition, mutual funds \nincrease liquidity in the money and capital market.  \n   10. Equity research Mutual funds can afford information and data required for \ninvestments as they have large amount of funds and equity research teams available \nwith them. History of Mutual Funds The history of mutual funds, dates back to 19th \ncentury Europe, in particular, Great Britain. Robert Fleming set up in 1868 the first \ninvestment trust called Foreign and Colonial Investment Trust which promised to \nmanage the finances of the moneyed classes of Scotland by spreading the investment \nover a number of different stocks. This investment trust and other investment trusts \nwhich were subsequently set up in Britain and the US, resembled today’s close$\nended mutual funds. The first mutual fund in the US, Massachusetts Investors’ Trust, \nwas setup in March 1924. This was the first open$ended mutual fund. The stock \nmarket crash in 1929, the Great Depression, and the outbreak of the Second World \nWar  slackened  the  pace  of  growth  of  the  mutual  fund  industry.  Innovations  in \nproducts and services increased the popularity of mutual funds in the 1950s and \n1960s. The first international stock mutual fund was introduced in the US in 1940. In \n1976, the first tax$exempt municipal bond funds emerged and in 1979, the first \nmoney market mutual funds were created. The latest additions are the international \nbond fund in 1986 and arm funds in 1990. This industry witnessed substantial growth \nin the eighties and nineties when there was a significant increase in the number of \nmutual funds, schemes, assets, and shareholders. In the US, the mutual fund industry ","metadata":{"source":"C:\\Users\\Vedant\\Documents\\Projects\\JPMC-CFG\\Team-2\\server\\assets\\dataset\\business_finance.pdf","pdf":{"version":"1.10.100","info":{"PDFFormatVersion":"1.4","IsAcroFormPresent":false,"IsXFAPresent":false,"Producer":"iLovePDF","ModDate":"D:20240615143501Z"},"metadata":null,"totalPages":344},"loc":{"pageNumber":236}}}],["e372a1bd-56b9-4a3e-94cb-d5b9b89650b6",{"pageContent":" \n238\nregistered  a  ten  fold  growth  in  the  eighties  (1980$89)  only,  with  25%  of  the \nhousehold sector’s investment in financial assets made through them. Fund assets \nincreased from less than $150 billion in 1980 to over $4 trillion by the end of 1997. \nSince  1996,  mutual  fund  assets  have  exceeded  bank  deposits.  The  mutual  fund \nindustry and the banking industry virtually rival each other in size.  \n   Growth of Mutual Funds in India :The Indian mutual fund industry has evolved \nover distinct stages. The growth of the mutual fund industry in India can be divided \ninto four phases:  \n   Phase  I  (1964$87),  Phase  II  (1987$92),  Phase  III  (1992$97),  and  Phase  IV \n(beyond 1997).  \n   Phase I: The mutual fund concept was introduced in India with the setting up of \nUTI in 1963. The Unit Trust of India (UTI) was the first mutual fund set up under the \nUTI Act, 1963, a special act of the Parliament. It became operational in 1964 with a \nmajor objective of mobilising savings through the sale of units and investing them in \ncorporate  securities  for  maximising  yield  and  capital  appreciation.  This  phase \ncommenced with the launch of Unit Scheme 1964 (US$64) the first open$ended and \nthe most popular scheme. UTI’s investible funds, at market value (and including the \nbook value of fixed assets) grew from Rs 49 crore in1965 to Rs 219 crore in 1970$71 \nto Rs 1,126 crore in 1980$81 and further to Rs 5,068 crore by June 1987. Its investor \nbase had also grown to about 2 million investors. It launched innovative schemes \nduring  this  phase.  Its  fund  family  included  five  income$oriented,  open$ended \nschemes, which were sold largely through its agent network built up over the years. \nMaster  share,  the  equity  growth  fund  launched  in  1986,  proved  to  be  a  grand \nmarketing success. Master share was the first real close$ended scheme floated by \nUTI.  It launched  India Fund in 1986$the first Indian offshore fund for overseas \ninvestors, which was listed on the London Stock Exchange (LSE). UTI maintained \nits monopoly and experienced a consistent growth till 1987.  \n   Phase  II:  The  second  phase  witnessed  the  entry  of mutual  fund  companies \nsponsored by nationalised banks and insurance companies. In 1987, SBI Mutual \nFund and Canbank Mutual Fund were set up as trusts under the Indian Trust Act, \n1882. In 1988, UTI floated another offshore fund, namely, The India Growth Fund \nwhich was listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE).

The assured return type of schemes floated by the \nmutual funds during this phase were perceived to be another banking product offered \nby the arms of sponsor banks. In October 1989, the first regulatory guidelines were \nissued by the Reserve Bank of India, but they were applicable only to the mutual \nfunds  sponsored  by  FIIs.  Subsequently,  the  Government  of  India  issued \ncomprehensive guidelines in June 1990 covering all ‘mutual funds. These guidelines \nemphasised compulsory registration with SEBI and an arms length relationship be \nmaintained between the sponsor and asset management company (AMC). With the \nentry of public sector funds, there was a tremendous growth in the size of the mutual \nfund industry with investible funds, at market value, increasing to Rs 53,462 crore \nand  the  number  of  investors  increasing  to  over  23  million.  The  buoyant  equity \nmarkets in 1991$92 and tax benefits under equity$linked savings schemes enhanced \nthe attractiveness of equity funds.  \n   Phase III: The year 1993 marked a turning point in the history of mutual funds \nin India. Tile Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) issued the Mutual Fund \nRegulations in January 1993. SEBI notified regulations bringing all mutual funds \nexcept UTI under a common regulatory framework. Private domestic and foreign \nplayers were allowed entry in the mutual fund industry. Kothari group of companies, \nin joint venture with Pioneer, a US fund company, set up the first private mutual fund \nthe Kothari Pioneer Mutual Fund, in 1993. Kothari Pioneer introduced the first open$\nended fund Prima in 1993. Several other private sector mutual funds were set up \nduring this phase. UTI launched a new scheme, Master$gain, in May 1992, which \nwas  a  phenomenal  success  with  a  subscription  of  Rs 4,700  crore  from  631akh \napplicants. The industry’s investible funds at market value increased to Rs 78,655 \ncrore and the number of investor accounts increased to 50 million. However, the year \n1995 was the beginning of the sluggish phase of the mutual fund industry. During \n1995 and 1996, unit holders saw an erosion in the value of their investments due to a \ndecline in the NA V s of the equity funds. Moreover, the service quality of mutual \nfunds declined due to a rapid growth in the number of investor accounts, and the \ninadequacy of service infrastructure. A lack of performance of the public sector \nfunds  and  miserable  failure  of  foreign  funds  like  Morgan  Stanley  eroded  the \nconfidence of investors in fund managers. Investors perception about mutual funds, \ngradually  turned  negative.

The average annual sales declined from about Rs13,000 . crore in 1991$94 to \nabout Rs 9,000 crore in 1995 and 1996.  \n   Phase IV: During this phase, the flow of funds into the kitty of mutual funds \nsharply increased. This significant growth was aided by a more positive sentiment in \nthe  capital  market,  significant  tax  benefits,  and  improvement  in  the  quality  of \ninvestor service. Investible funds, at market value, of the industry rose by June 2000 \nto over Rs 1,10,000 crore with UTI having 68% of the market share. During 1999$\n2000 sales mobilisation reached a record level of Rs 73,000 crore as against Rs \n31,420 crore in the preceding year. This trend was, however, sharply reversed in \n2000$01. The UTI dropped a bombshell on the investing public by disclosing the \nNAV of US$64$its flagship scheme as on December 28,2000, just at Rs 5.81 as \nagainst the face value of Rs 10 and the last sale price of Rs 14.50. The disclosure of \nNAV of the country’s largest mutual fund scheme was the biggest shock of the year \nto investors. Crumbling global equity markets, a sluggish economy coupled with bad \ninvestment decisions made life tough for big funds across the world in 2001$02. The \neffect of these problems was felt strongly in India also. Pioneer m, JP Morgan and \nNewton Investment Management pulled out from the Indian market. Bank of India \nMF liquidated all its schemes in 2002. The Indian mutual fund industry has stagnated \nat around Rs 1,00,000 crore assets since 2000$01. This stagnation is partly a result of \nstagnated equity markets and the indifferent performance by players. As against this, \nthe aggregate deposits of Scheduled Commercial Banks (SCBs) as on May 3, 2002, \nstood at Rs 11,86,468 crore. Mutual funds assets under management (AUM) form \njust around 10% of deposits of SCBs. The Unit Trust of India is losing out to other \nprivate sector players. While there has been an increase in AUM by around 11% \nduring the year 2002, UTI on the contrary has lost more than 11% in AUM. The \nprivate sector mutual funds have benefited the most from the debacle ofUS$64 of \nUTI. The AUM of this sector grew by around$ 60% for the year ending March 2002. \nTypes  of  Mutual  Fund  Schemes  The  objectives  of  mutual  funds  are  to  provide \ncontinuous liquidity and higher yields with high degree of safety to investors. Based \non these objectives, different types of mutual fund schemes have evolved.  \n2.2.1.2 Types of Mutual Fund Schemes : \nFunctional Classification of Mutual Funds: ","metadata":{"source":"C:\\Users\\Vedant\\Documents\\Projects\\JPMC-CFG\\Team-2\\server\\assets\\dataset\\business_finance.pdf","pdf":{"version":"1.10.100","info":{"PDFFormatVersion":"1.4","IsAcroFormPresent":false,"IsXFAPresent":false,"Producer":"iLovePDF","ModDate":"D:20240615143501Z"},"metadata":null,"totalPages":344},"loc":{"pageNumber":239}}}],["aeaa0bcf-a571-41c5-a73c-5597f0cc479c",{"pageContent":" \n241\n 1.  Open-ended  schemes:  In  case  of  open$ended  schemes,  the  mutual  fund \ncontinuously offers to sell and repurchase its units at net asset value (NAV) or NAV$\nrelated prices. Unlike close$ended schemes, open$ended ones do not have to be listed \non the stock exchange and can also offer repurchase soon after allotment. Investors \ncan enter and exit the scheme any time during the life of the fund. Open$ended \nschemes do not have a fixed corpus. The corpus of fund increases or decreases, \ndepending on the purchase or redemption of units by investors. There is no fixed \nredemption period in open$ended schemes, which can be terminated whenever the \nneed arises. The fund offers a redemption price at which the holder can sell units to \nthe fund and exit. Besides, an investor can enter the fund again by buying units from \nthe fund at its offer price. Such funds announce sale and repurchase prices from time$\nto$time. UTI’s US$64 scheme is an example of such a fund. The key feature of open$\nended funds is liquidity. They increase liquidity of the investors as the units can be \ncontinuously bought and sold. The investors can develop their income or saving plan \ndue to free entry and exit frame of funds. Open$ended schemes usually come as a \nfamily of schemes which enable the investors to switch over from one scheme to \nanother of same family.  \n 2.  Close-ended  schemes:  Close$ended  schemes  have  a  fixed  corpus  and  a \nstipulated maturity period ranging between 2 to 5 years. Investors can invest in the \nscheme when it is launched. The scheme remains open for a period not exceeding 45 \ndays. Investors in close$ended schemes can buy units only from the market, once \ninitial subscriptions are over and thereafter the units are listed on the stock exchanges \nwhere they dm be bought and sold. The fund has no interaction with investors till \nredemption except for paying dividend/bonus. In order to provide an alternate exit \nroute to the investors, some close$ended funds give an option of selling back the \nunits to the mutual fund through periodic repurchase at NAV related prices. If an \ninvestor sells units directly to the fund, he cannot enter the fund again, as units \nbought  back  by  the  fund  cannot  be  reissued.  The  close$ended  scheme  can  be \nconverted into an open$ended one. The units can be rolled over by the passing of a \nresolution by a majority of the unit$$holders.  \n 3. Interval scheme: Interval scheme combines the features of open$ended and \nclose$ended schemes. They are open for sale or redemption during predetermined \nintervals at NAVrelated prices.

Such schemes invest predominantly in income$bearing instruments like \nbonds, debentures, government securities, and commercial paper. The return as well \nas the risk are lower in income funds as compared to growth funds.   \n Growth funds: The main objective of growth funds is capital appreciation over \nthe medium$to$long$ term. They invest most of the corpus in equity shares with \nsignificant growth potential and they offer higher return to investors in the long$term. \nThey assume the risks associated with equity investments. There is no guarantee or \nassurance of returns. These schemes are usually close$ended and listed on stock \nexchanges.  \n 3.  Balanced  funds: The aim of balanced scheme is to provide both capital \nappreciation and regular income. They divide their investment between equity shares \nand fixed nicebearing instruments in such a proportion that, the portfolio is balanced. \nThe portfolio of such funds usually comprises of companies with good profit and \ndividend track records. Their exposure to risk is moderate and they offer a reasonable \nrate of return.  \n 4.  Money  market  mutual  funds: They specialise in investing in short$term \nmoney  market  instruments  like  treasury  bills,  and  certificate  of  deposits.  The \nobjective of such funds is high liquidity with low rate of return.  \nGeographical Classification  \n 1.  Domestic  funds:  Funds  which  mobilise  resources  from  a  particular \ngeographical locality like a country or region are domestic funds. The market is \nlimited and confined to the boundaries of a nation in which the fund operates. They \ncan invest only in the securities which are issued and traded in the domestic financial \nmarkets.  \n 2. Offshore funds: Offshore funds attract foreign capital for investment in ‘the \ncountry of the issuing company. They facilitate cross$border fund flow which leads \nto an increase in foreign currency and foreign exchange reserves. Such mutual funds \ncan invest in securities of foreign companies. They open domestic capital market to \ninternational  investors.  Many  mutual  funds  in  India  have  launched  a  number  of \noffshore funds, either independently or jointly with foreign investment management \ncompanies.

Sectoral:  These  funds  invest  in  specific  core  sectors  like  energy, \ntelecommunications, IT, construction, transportation, and financial services. Some of \nthese newly opened$up sectors offer good investment potential.  \n 2. Tax saving schemes: Tax$saving schemes are designed on the basis of tax \npolicy  with  special  tax  incentives  to  investors.  Mutual  funds  have  introduced  a \nnumber of tax saving schemes. These are close$$ended schemes and investments are \nmade for ten years, although investors can avail of encashment facilities after 3 \nyears.  These  schemes  contain  various  options  like  income,  growth  or  capital \napplication. The latest scheme offered is the Systematic Withdrawal Plan (SWP) \nwhich enables investors to reduce their tax incidence on dividends from as high as \n30% to as low as 3 to 4%.  \n 3. Equity-linked savings scheme (ELSS): In order to encourage investors to \ninvest in equity market, the government has given tax$concessions through special \nschemes. Investment in these schemes entitles the investor to claim an income tax \nrebate, but these schemes carry a lock$in period before the end of which funds cannot \nbe withdrawn.  \n 4. Special schemes: Mutual funds have launched special schemes to cater to the \nspecial needs of investors. UTI has launched special schemes such as Children’s Gift \nGrowth Fund, 1986, Housing Unit Scheme, 1992, and Venture Capital Funds.  \n 5. Gilt funds: Mutual funds which deal exclusively in gilts are called gilt funds. \nWith a view to creating a wider investor base for government securities, the Reserve \nBank of India encouraged setting up of gilt funds. These funds are provided liquidity \nsupport by the Reserve Bank.  \n 6.  Load  funds:  Mutual  funds  incur  certain  expenses  such  as  brokerage, \nmarketing expenses, and communication expenses. These expenses are known as \n‘load’  and  are  recovered  by  the  fund  when  it  sells the  units  to  investors  or \nrepurchases the units from withholders. In other words, load is a sales charge, or \ncommission, assessed by certain mutual funds to cover their selling costs. Loads can \nbe of two types$Front$end$load and back$endload. Front$end$load, or sale load, is a \ncharge collected at the time when an investor enters into the scheme. Back$end, or \nrepurchase, load is a charge collected when the investor gets out of the scheme. \nSchemes that do not charge a load are called ‘No load’ schemes.

However, these no$load \nschemes can have an exit load when the unit holder gets out of the scheme before a  \nstipulated period mentioned in the initial offer. This is done to prevent short$term \ninvestments and redemptions. Some funds may also charge different amount of loads \nto investors depending upon the time period the investor has stayed with the funds. \nThe longer the investor stays with the fund, less is the amount of exit load charged. \nThis is known as contingent deferred sales’ charge (CDSL). It is a back$end (exit \nload)  fee  imposed  by  certain  funds  on  shares  redeemed  with  a  specific  period \nfollowing their purchase and is usually assessed on a sliding scale.  \n 7. Index funds: An index fund is a mutual fund which invests in securities in \nthe index on which it is based BSE Sensex or S&P CNX Nifty. It invests only in \nthose shares which comprise the market index and in exactly the same proportion as \nthe companies/weightage in the index so that the value of such index funds varies \nwith the market index. An index fund follows a passive investment strategy as no \neffort is made by the fund manager to identify stocks for investment/dis$investment. \nThe fund manager has to merely track the index on which it is based. His portfolio \nwill need an adjustment in case there is a revision in the underlying index. In other \nwords, the fund manager has to buy stocks which are added to the index and sell \nstocks  which  are  deleted  from  the  index.  Internationally,  index  funds  are  very \npopular. Around onethird of professionally run portfolios in the US are index funds. \nEmpirical  evidence  points  out  that  active  fund  managers  have  not  been  able  to \nperform well. Only 20$25% of actively managed equity mutual funds out$perform \nbenchmark indices in the long$term. These active fund managers park 80% of their \nmoney in an index and do active management on the remaining 20%. Moreover, risk \naverse  investors  like  provident  funds  and  pension  funds  prefer  investment  in \npassively managed funds like index funds.  \n 8. PE ratio fund: PE ratio fund is another mutual fund variant that is offered by \nPioneer IT! Mutual Fund. The PE (Price$Earnings) ratio is the ratio of the price of \nthe stock of a company to its earnings per share (EPS). The PE ratio of the index is \nthe weighted average price$earnings ratio of all its constituent stocks.

Exchange  traded  funds: Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) are a hybrid of \nopen$ended  mutual  funds  and  listed  individual  stocks.  They  are  listed  on  stock \nexchanges and trade like individual stocks on the stock exchange. However, trading \nat the stock exchanges does not affect their portfolio. ETFs do not sell their shares \ndirectly to investors for cash. The shares are offered to investors over the stock \nexchange. ETFs are basically passively managed funds that track a particular index \nsuch as S&P CNX Nifty. Since they are listed on stock exchanges, it is possible to \nbuy and sell them throughout the day and their price is determined by the demand$\nsupply forces in the market. In practice, they trade in a small range around the value \nof the assets (NAV) held by them. ETFs offer several distinct advantages. ·ETFs \nbring the trading and real time pricing advantages of individual stocks to mutual \nfunds. The ability to trade intraday at prices that are usually close to the actual intra$\nday NAV of the scheme makes it almost real$time trading. ·ETFs are simpler to \nunderstand and hence they can attract small investors who are deterred to trade in \nindex futures due to requirement of minimum contract size. Small investors can buy \nminimum one unit of ETF, can place limit orders and trade intra$day. This, in turn, \nwould  increase  liquidity  of  the  cash  market.  ·ETFs can  be  used  to  arbitrate \neffectively between index futures and spot index. ·ETFs provide the  benefits of \ndiversified index funds. The investor can benefit from the flexibility of stocks as well \nas the diversification. ·ETFs being passively managed, have somewhat higher NAV \nagainst an index fund of the same portfolio. The operating expenses of ETFs are \nlower than even those of similar index funds as they do not have to service investors \nwho deal in shares through stock exchanges. ·ETFs can be beneficial for financial \ninstitutions also. Financial institutions can use ETFs for utilizing idle cash, managing \nredemptions, modifying sector allocations, and hedging market exposure.

In other words, it is the amount \nwhich the shareholders will collectively get if the fund is dissolved or liquidated. The \nnet asset value of a unit is the net asset value of fund divided by the number of \noutstanding units. Thus NAV = Market Price of Securities + Other Assets $ Total \nLiabilities  +  Units  Outstanding  as  at  the  NAV  date.

It is necessary for investors \nto take all decisions as regards their wealth position in a context of portfolio. Making \na portfolio means putting ones eggs in different baskets with varying element of risk \nand return. The object of portfolio is to reduce risk by diversification and maximise \ngains. Thus, portfolio is a combination of various instruments of investment. It is \nalso a combination of securities with different risk$return characteristics. A portfolio \nis built up out of the wealth or income of the investor over a period of time with a \nview to manage the risk$return preferences.

In \nIndia,  as  well  as  in  many  western  countries,  portfolio  management  service  has \nassumed the role of specialized service now a days and a number of professional \nmerchant bankers compete aggressively to provide the best to high net$worth clients, \nwho have little time to manage their investments. The idea is catching up with the \nboom in the capital market and an increasing number of people are inclined to make \nthe profits out of their hard earned savings.

It  is  the  basis  of  all  scientific  portfolio  management.  Although  the \nexpected  return  on  a  portfolio  is  directly  related to  the  expected  returns  on \ncomponent securities, it is not possible to deduce a portfolio riskiness simply by \nknowing the riskiness of individual securities. The riskiness of portfolio depends \nupon the attributes of individual securities as well as the interrelationships among \nsecurities. A professional, who manages other people's or institution's investment \nportfolio with the object of profitability, growth and risk minimization is known as a \nportfolio manager. He is expected to manage the investor's assets prudently and \nchoose  particular  investment  avenues  appropriate  for  particular  times  aiming  at \nmaximization of profit.

Investing in \nsecurities presupposes risk. A common way of reducing risk is to follow the principle \nof diversification. Diversification is investing in a number of different securities \nrather than concentrating in one or two securities. The diversification assures the \nbenefit  of  obtaining  the  anticipated  return  on  the portfolio  of  securities.  In  a \ndiversified  portfolio,  some  securities  may  not  perform  as  expected  but  other \nsecurities  may  exceed  expectations  with  the  effect that  the  actual  results  of  the \nportfolio will be reasonably close to the anticipated results.  \nMEARCHANT BANKING / INVESTMENT BANKING  \n   A merchant bank is a financial institution primarily engaged in offering financial \nservices and advice to corporations and to wealthy individuals. The term can also be \nused  to  describe  the  private  equity  activities  of  banking.  The  chief  distinction \nbetween an investment bank and a merchant bank is that a merchant bank invests its \nown capital in a client company whereas an investment bank purely distributes (and \ntrades) the securities of that company in its capital raising role. Both merchant banks \nand  investment  banks  provide  fee  based  corporate  advisory  services.  Merchant \nbanking services  are provided by the financial institutions, subsidiaries of many \ncommercial banks and by the private sector. The activities that merchant bankers are \nauthorised to perform are listed by the SEBI and include issue management, loan \nsyndication,  lease  financing,  corporate  advisory  services,  underwriting,  portfolio \nmanagement services and managers or consultants to public issues.  \nROLE OF PORTFOLIO MANAGER \n   A portfolio manager is a person who makes investment decisions using money \nother people have placed under his or her control.

It is also surprising that the saving \nrate in India is as high as 32% of GDP per annum and investment at 34% of GDP. \nHigh levels of investment could not generate comparable rates of growth of output \nbecause of poor investment strategy, high capital output ratios, low productivity of \ncapital and high rates of obsolescence of capital. Thus, the use of capital in India is \nwasteful and inefficient.

Since 1952, investors \nhave better understood the dimension of attractiveness and why the rational and \nprofessional management of portfolios includes more than the listing of securities by \nthe magnitude of their expected returns. The great 1952 event was the publication of \nHarry Markowitz's celebrated article \"Portfolio selection.\" Markowitz analyzed the \nimplications  of  the  fact  that  investors  although  seeking  high  expected  returns \ngenerally wish to avoid risk. Since there is overwhelming evidence that risk aversion \ncharacterizes most investors, especially most large$investor's rationality in portfolio \nmanagement demands that account be taken not only expected returns for a portfolio \nbut also of the risk that is incurred. Although the expected return on a portfolio is \ndirectly related to the expected returns on component securities, it is impossible to \ndeduce  a  portfolio's  riskiness  simply  by  knowing  the  riskiness  of  individual \nsecurities. The riskiness of portfolios depends not only on the attributes of individual \nsecurities,  but  also  on  the  interrelationships  among  securities.  Therefore,  it  is \nprimarily for this reason that portfolio management is desirable. Another reason for \nthe  need  for  portfolio  management  is  that  it  depends  upon  the  preferences  of \nindividual  investors.  It  is  possible  to  estimate  expected  returns  for  individual \nsecurities without regard to any investor, but it is impossible to construct on optimal \nportfolio for an investor without taking personal preferences into account. The output \nof  security  analysts  is  essential  for  portfolio  management  or  at  least  portfolio \nmanagers make use of security analysts output but this output must be analyzed with \nreference  to  the  tastes  and  financial  circumstances  of  individual  investors  when \nbuilding portfolios. Portfolio management is still in its infancy in India. Professional \nportfolio management started in India after the setting up of public sector mutual \nfunds in 1987. After the success of mutual funds in portfolio management, a number \nof brokers and investment consultants have become portfolio managers. Basically \nportfolio management is required for proper investment decision$making regarding \nbuy and sell of securities. There is a need for proper money management in terms of \ninvestment as a basket of assets so as to satisfy the asset preferences of the investors \nand to reduce the risk and increase the returns on investment.  \nPOPULARITY OF EQUITY PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT SERVICES  \n   Portfolio  Management  Service  (PMS)  is  a  professional  service  rendered  for \nmanagement of portfolio of others with the help of experts in Investment advisory \nservices.

Portfolio management is \nan art and requires high degree of expertise. The SEBI has set out guidelines in \nwhich the relationship of the client and the portfolio manager and the respective \nrights and duties of both have been set out. The job of the portfolio manager in \nmanaging the client's fund either on discretionary or non$discretionary  basis has \nbecome challenging and difficult due to the multitude of obligations laid on his \nshoulders by the SEBI, in respect of their operations, accounts and audit. Thus, \nportfolio management has become a complex and responsible job which requires an \nin$depth training and expertise. The activities of buying and selling of securities in \nthe primary as well as secondary market are carried out through the mechanism of \nstock exchanges. There has been a substantial growth of capital market in India \nduring the last 25 years. There are 23 stock exchanges in India and more than 9500 \nlisted companies. There were 56,588 capital issues and the market value of capital \nwas Rs.12,01,207 crores till 2004$05. As per SEBI regulations, only those who are \nregistered with SEBI are eligible to operate as a portfolio manager. They have to pay \nrequired license fees. For this purpose the eligible persons should have necessary \ninfrastructure with professionally qualified persons and minimum net worth of Rs.50 \nlakhs. The SEBI has imposed a number of obligations and a code of conduct on the \nportfolio managers.  \nTYPES OF PORTFOLIO  \n   When it comes to investing there are many options available to individuals. A \nperson can invest in stocks, bonds, mutual funds, etc. Once a person invests in \nmultiple  products  their  performance  needs  to  be  tracked  and  strategies  made  to \nensure the investor reaps the most profit possible. This is where the investment \nportfolio  comes  into  play.  According  to  Investor  Awareness,  it  is  a  term  that \ndescribes all investments owned. To take this definition a little farther, an investment \nportfolio is a significant aspect in diversification. Maintaining a diverse portfolio \nhelps to mitigate loss because the investor has not placed all of their eggs in one \nbasket. There are different types of investment portfolios. Perhaps the most common \ntype’s  individuals  are  exposed  to  are:  Conservative,  Balanced  and  Aggressive \nGrowth.  A  portfolio  is  a  combination  of  different  investment  assets  mixed  and \nmatched for the purpose of achieving an investor's goals.

For the purpose of this section, Investors will focus on the most liquid \nasset types: equities, fixed$income securities and cash and equivalents. The asset mix \nthey choose according to their aims and strategy will determine the risk and expected \nreturn of their portfolio. 1. Aggressive Investment Portfolio In general, aggressive \ninvestment strategies $ those that shoot for the highest possible return $ are most \nappropriate for investors who, for the sake of this potential high return, have a high \nrisk tolerance and a longer time horizon. Aggressive portfolios generally have a \nhigher investment in equities. Aggressive investment portfolios are for investors not \nafraid of high risk. This type of portfolio may incorporate mutual funds that aim for \nhigh capital gain, equities, stocks, bonds, cash and maybe some commodities. In the \nshort$term, growth will be very small and some loss will be observed. As a result, \naggressive portfolios perform better in the long term $ about five years or longer. An \nactively  traded  aggressive  portfolio  will  typically  gain  maximum  returns  for  the \ninvestor. The loss factor is why only individuals who are willing to take a high \nfinancial risk should seek an aggressive investment portfolio. An aggressive portfolio \ncontains  high  growth  investments  that  will  hopefully  appreciate  in  value.  This \nstrategy attempts to achieve high long$term growth by investing in often risky but \nprofitable,  short$term  stocks.  Under  normal  market conditions,  the  Aggressive \nGrowth  Portfolio  will  invest  approximately  100%  of its  total  assets  in  equity \nsecurities. The Aggressive Growth Portfolio can invest up to 100% of its total assets \nin equity securities and up to 25% of its total assets in fixed income securities. 2. \nBalanced or Moderate Investment Portfolio A moderately aggressive portfolio is \nmeant for individuals with a longer time horizon and an average risk tolerance. \nInvestors who find these types of portfolios attractive are seeking to balance the \namount of risk and return contained within the fund. The portfolio would consist of \napproximately 50$55% equities, 35$40% bonds, 5$10% cash and equivalents. The \nModerate  Portfolio's  primary  investment  objective  is  to  seek  long$term  capital \nappreciation and also the Moderate Portfolio seeks current income. 3. Conservative \nInvestment Portfolio The conservative investment strategies, which put safety at a \nhigh priority, are most appropriate for investors who are risk averse and have a \nshorter time horizon. Conservative portfolios will generally consist mainly of cash \nand cash equivalents, or high$quality fixed$income instruments. The main goal of a \nconservative portfolio strategy is to maintain the real value of the portfolio, or to \nprotect the value of the portfolio against inflation.

The \nconservative investment portfolio is geared towards preserving capital. A minimal \nrisk investment strategy is used. This type of portfolio is ideal for retirees who are \nfocused more on having assets available than a stream of income from interest. Since \nthe  primary  goal  is  to  preserve  capital,  investors can  dip  into  their  principal  to \nsupplement living expenses instead of relying on the portfolio's earned income. The \nConservative  Portfolio's  primary  investment  objective  is  to  seek  preservation  of \ncapital  and  current  income.  The  Conservative  Portfolio  also  seeks  capital \nappreciation. Under normal market conditions, the Conservative Portfolio will invest \napproximately  65%  of  its  total  assets  in  fixed  income  securities  and  cash  and \napproximately 35% of its total assets in equity securities. The Conservative Portfolio \ncan invest up to 100% of its total assets in fixed income securities and or some time \nup to 20% of its total assets in equity securities. Investors can further break down the \nabove asset classes into subclasses, which also have different risks and potential \nreturns. For example, an investor might divide the equity portion between large \ncompanies, small companies and international firms. The bond portion might be \nallocated  between  those  that  are  short$term  and  long$term,  government  versus \ncorporate debt, and so forth. More advanced investors might also have some of the \nalternative assets such as options and futures in the mix. As, the number of possible \nasset allocations is practically unlimited.  \nNEED AND IMPORTANCE OF PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT  \n   Portfolio management is a process encompassing many activities of investment \nin assets and securities. It is a dynamic and flexible concept and involves regular and \nsystematic analysis, judgment and action. The objective of this service is to help the \nunknown and investors with the expertise of professionals in investment portfolio \nmanagement.  It  involves  construction  of  a  portfolio  based  upon  the  investor’s \nobjectives, constraints, preferences for risk and returns and tax liability. The portfolio \nis reviewed and adjusted from time to time in tune with the market conditions. The \nevaluation of portfolio is to be done in terms of targets set for risk and returns. The \nchanges in the portfolio are to be effected to meet the changing condition. Portfolio \nconstruction refers to the allocation of surplus funds in hand among a variety of \nfinancial  assets  open  for  investment.

But the lack of \nawareness  and  financial  literacy  among  the  rural  population  of  the  country  is \nhindering the growth of the economy as majority of the population does not have \naccess to formal credit. This is a serious issue for the economic progress of the \ncountry. In order to overcome such barriers, the banking sector emerged with some \ntechnological innovations such as automated teller machines (ATM), credit and debit \ncards,  internet  banking,  etc.  Though  introduction  of  such  banking  technologies \nbrought a change in the urban society, a majority of the rural population is still \nunaware of these changes and is excluded from formal banking. Financial inclusion \nenables improved and better sustainable economic and social development of the \ncountry. It helps in the empowerment of the underprivileged, poor and women of the \nsociety with the mission of making them self$sufficient and well informed to take \nbetter financial decisions. Financial inclusion takes into account the participation of \nvulnerable groups such as weaker sections of the society and low income groups, \nbased on the extent of their access to financial services such as savings and payment \naccount,  credit  insurance,  pensions  etc.  Also  the  objective  of  financial  inclusion \nexercise is easy availability of financial services which allows maximum investment \nin business opportunities, education, save for retirement, insurance against risks, etc. \nby the rural individuals and firms. The penetration of financial services in the rural \nareas of India is still very low. The factors responsible for this condition can be \nlooked at from both supply side and demand side and the major reason for low \npenetration of financial services is, probably, lack of supply. The reasons for low ","metadata":{"source":"C:\\Users\\Vedant\\Documents\\Projects\\JPMC-CFG\\Team-2\\server\\assets\\dataset\\business_finance.pdf","pdf":{"version":"1.10.100","info":{"PDFFormatVersion":"1.4","IsAcroFormPresent":false,"IsXFAPresent":false,"Producer":"iLovePDF","ModDate":"D:20240615143501Z"},"metadata":null,"totalPages":344},"loc":{"pageNumber":258}}}],["69ec7144-f477-4329-9b7f-099f908cd373",{"pageContent":" \n260\ndemand for financial services could be low income level, lack of financial literacy, \nother bank accounts in the family, etc. On the other hand, the supply side factors \ninclude no bank branch in the vicinity, lack of suitable products meeting the needs of \nthe poor people, complex processes and language barriers. Since 2005, the Reserve \nBank of India (RBI) and the Government of India (GOI) have been making efforts to \nincrease financial inclusion. Measures such as SHG$bank linkage program, use of \nbusiness facilitators and correspondents, easing of Know Your Customer (KYC) \nnorms, electronic benefit transfer, separate plan for urban financial inclusion, use of \nmobile technology, bank branches and ATMs, opening and encouraging ‘no$frill$\naccounts’  and  emphasis  on  financial  literacy  have  played  a  significant  role  for \nincreasing the use of formal sources for availing loan/ credit. Measures initiated by \nthe government include, opening customer service centers, credit counselling centers, \nKisan Credit Card, Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme \nand  Aadhar  Scheme.  These  renewed  efforts  are  more  focused  than  the  earlier \nmeasures which were more general in nature having a much wider scope. Though the \nmeasures were initiated earlier, their impact on the rural population needs to be \nanalysed and reframed in order to understand the present scenario in the rural areas. \nThis paper is arranged in six sections.  \nDefinition of Financial Inclusion: \n    According to the Planning Commission (2009), Financial inclusion refers to \nuniversal access to a wide range of financial services at a reasonable cost. These \ninclude not only banking products but also other financial services such as insurance \nand equity products. The household access to financial services includes access to \ncontingency planning, credit and wealth creation. Access to contingency planning \nwould  help  for  future  savings  such  as  retirement  savings,  buffer  savings  and \ninsurable contingencies and access to credit includes emergency loans, housing loans \nand consumption loans. On the other hand, access to wealth creation includes savings \nand investment based on household’s level of financial literacy and risk perception.  \n   GOI (2008) defines Financial inclusion as the process of ensuring access to \nfinancial services and timely and adequate credit where needed by vulnerable groups \nsuch as weaker sections and low income groups at an affordable cost. The meaning \nof financial inclusion is delivery of financial services to the low income groups \nespecially  the  excluded  sections  of  the  population with  the  provision  of  equal ","metadata":{"source":"C:\\Users\\Vedant\\Documents\\Projects\\JPMC-CFG\\Team-2\\server\\assets\\dataset\\business_finance.pdf","pdf":{"version":"1.10.100","info":{"PDFFormatVersion":"1.4","IsAcroFormPresent":false,"IsXFAPresent":false,"Producer":"iLovePDF","ModDate":"D:20240615143501Z"},"metadata":null,"totalPages":344},"loc":{"pageNumber":259}}}],["bf405605-99dd-4235-9eb9-0077f4ae4bcf",{"pageContent":" \n261\nopportunities. The main target is the access of financial services for better standard \nof living and income.  \n   According to Chakraborty (2011), Financial inclusion is the process of ensuring \naccess to appropriate financial products and services needed by all sections of society \nincluding vulnerable groups such as weaker sections and low income groups at an \naffordable cost in a fair and transparent manner by mainstream institutional players. \nThis issue started gaining importance recently in the news media. However, as is the \ncase with several issues in India, financial inclusion has remained a pipe dream with \na majority of Indians continuing to lack access to banking services.  \n   Dimensions of Financial Inclusion The level of financial inclusion in India can \nbe measured based on three tangible and critical dimensions. These dimensions can \nbe broadly discussed under the following heads: \nI.   Branch Penetration Penetration of a bank branch is measured as number of bank \nbranches per one lakh population. This refers to the penetration of commercial bank \nbranches and ATMs for the provision of maximum formal financial services to the \nrural population. \nII.   Credit Penetration Credit Penetration takes the average of the three measures: \nnumber of loan accounts per one lakh population, number of small borrower loan \naccounts per one lakh population and number of agriculture advances per one lakh \npopulation.  \nIII.  Deposit  Penetration  Deposit  penetration  can  be  measured  as  the  number  of \nsaving deposit accounts per one lakh population. With the help of this measure, the \nextent  of  the  usage  of  formal  credit  system  can  be analysed.  Among  the  three \ndimensions  of  financial  inclusion,  credit  penetration  is  the  key  problem  in  the \ncountry as the all India average ranks the lowest for credit penetration compared to \nthe other two dimensions. Such low penetration of credit is the result of lack of \naccess  to  credit  among  the  rural  households.  Therefore,  the  problem  of  low \npenetration needs to be understood more deeply. An attempt has been made to study \nthe problem by examining the progress of financial inclusion over the years and \nefforts made by the government for reducing the low penetration of credit. The \nprogress in the development of financial inclusion in India can be examined by \nunderstanding the stages involved in it.

The results of the survey revealed that farmers relied heavily \non money$lenders in the year 1951$52. Only the urban areas had large number of \nbank branches compared to rural areas. Such a condition continued in the country \nuntil RBI started financial inclusion growth model in the 2000s. Because the urban \nareas were fully concentrated with numerous bank branches, this resulted in the \nhigher absorption of bank credit in the urban areas. Thus, the growth of the private \nbusiness credit was seen in the year 1957$61 from 44 percent to 60 percent in the \nyear 19702. \n2.2.3.2 Policy Initiatives for Financial Inclusion \n   For increasing the level of financial inclusion, the GOI and RBI have taken few \nactions which include the following:  \n•   Nationalization of banks (1969, 1980) \n•   Priority Sector Lending requirements \n•   Establishment of Regional Rural Banks (RRBs) (1975, 1976) \n•   Service area approach (1989) \n•   Self$help group$bank linkage program (1989,1990)  \n   The other measures taken by GOI, RBI and National Bank for Agriculture and \nRural Development (NABARD) are :. Customer Service Centres, Credit Counselling \nCentres,Adhaar  Scheme  The  National  Agricultural  Insurance  Scheme,  No$frill \nAccount, Know Your Customer, General Credit Card Project on Processor Cards, \nMicro Finance Development Fund,  Financial Inclusion Fund Project on “e$Grama” \nSHG$Post Office Linkage Financial Inclusion Technology Fund Separate Plan for \nUrban  Financial  Inclusion  and  Electronic  Benefit  Transfer  Scheme  Financial \nLiteracy through Audio Visual medium $ Doordarshan Support to Cooperative Banks \nand RRBs for setting up of Financial Literacy Centres Farmers’ Club Program Rural \nVolunteers etc. Though a number of measures have been initiated by the GOI, RBI \nand  NABARD,  the  status  of  financial  inclusion  in  the  country  still  needs  more \nsupport. The condition of financial inclusion in the different states of India in 2002 \nwas not encouraging It shows that the all India percentage of the level of non$\nindebtedness, i.e. level of not accessing formal credit, of the rural household is 51.4 \npercent. This low credit penetration after years of measures was a matter of concern \nand still there is a lot of work to be done in the area of financial inclusion.

India has been able to develop its own model of \nmicrofinance organizations in the form of savings and credit groups known as the \nSelf Help Group (SHGs), which are bank$linked. These SHGs are mainly formed and \nmanaged by women and this has become an instrument, which has led to women's \nempowerment  and  social  change.  Most  of  the  microfinance  institutions  in  India \nattempt to go beyond savings and credit groups to provide microfinance services in \nthe form of savings and insurance. Microfinance provides financial services to those \nwhose income is small and unstable. These people are in need of credit facilities for \nseveral  reasons  (i)  their  needs  are  small  and  arise  suddenly  (2)  the  institutional \nproviders of finance namely the banks demand collateral security which they cannot \nprovide (3) most of the time, they are in needs of funds to meet their consumption \ndemands,  for  example,  to  meet  expenses  related  to  education,  illness,  funerals, \nweddings for which it is difficult to obtain institution finance (4) for purpose of \ninvestment in income generating activities. \n   The Indian microfinance scene is dominated by SHGs and their linkage with \nBanks.

In India, microfinance has fulled the efforts of \nrural development, women empowerment and wealth generation by providing small \nscale savings, credit, insurance and other financial services to poor and low income \nhouseholds. Microfinance thus serves as a means to empower the poor and provides \na  valuable  tool  to  help  the  economic  development  process.  The  concept  of \nmicrofinancing  and  self$employment  activities  in  rural  areas  has  developed \nconsiderably over the last two decades.

Theoretically,  microfinance  also  known  as \nmicrocredit or microlending means making provision for smaller working capital \nloans to the selfemployed or self$employment seeking poor. Microcredit has defined \nas the extension of small loans to be given in multiple doses based on the absorption \ncapacity of the needy beneficiaries, who are too poor to qualify for formal bank \nloans, as they have no assets to offer as collateral security against loans. 'Microcredit' \nmay be defined as the credit and repeated credit provided in small measures to suit \nthe  recipient's  requirements,  with  a  comfortable  pace  of  repayment  and  at  an \nappropriate rate of interest. Microcredit has been defined by the microcredit summit \nheld in Washington D.C. in February 1997 as \"programmes that provide credit for \nself  employment,  other  financial  and  business  services  to  very  poor  persons.\" \nMicrofinance  can  be  interpreted  in  a  broader  context  both  as  microcredit  and \nmicrosavings,  even  though  microcredit  and  microfinance  have  come  to  used \ninterchangeably. However, when the term 'microfinance' is used it implies some \nother  services  accompanying  credit  viz.  facilities for  saving  and  availability  of \nservices  for  insurance  of  the  assets  acquired  with microcredit.  Microfinance  has \ncome to be referred to as a small scale financial services and technical assistance \nprovided to rural people who operate small or micro$enterprises, provide services, \nwork for wages or commission and other individuals and group working at local \nlevels. NABARD has defined microfinance as \"provision of thrift, credit and other \nfinancial services and products of very small amounts to the poor in rural, semiurban \nand  urban  provided  to  customers  to  meet  their  financial  needs;  with  only \nqualification that (1) transactions value is small and (2) customers are poor.\" In \nessence, therefore, microfinance could be referred to as an institutional mechanism of \nproviding credit support in small amount and usually linked with small groups along \nwith other complementary support such as training and other related services to the \npeople  with  poor  resources  and  skills  for  enabling them  to  take  up  economic \nactivities. In the November 1995 Microcredit Summit, U.S. first lady Hillary Clinton \nwrote;  \"Microenterprise  is  the  heart  of  development  because  microenterprise \nprogrammes work $ they lift women and families out of poverty. It is called micro \nbut its impact on people is macro, we have seen that it takes just a few dollars, often \nas little it takes as dollar 10, to help a woman gain self employment, lift her and her \nfamily out of poverty. It is not a hand out; it is a helping hand.\" Let us begin by \nunderstanding  some  of  the  distinct  characteristics of  microfinance.

While there are \ncertain similarities between the two terms, there are also certain differences, which \nrequire  to  be  classified  at  the  very  start  to  avoid  confusion  of  time.  The  term \nmicrocredit refers to a small size loan, to be repaid within a short period of time, \nused mostly low income households and micro entrepreneurs for the purpose of \nincome generation and enterprise development. The mobilization of such credit is \nrestricted to external sources such as banks and moneylenders. Microfinance on the \nhand, provides a greater menu of options whereby the small loan can be garnered not \njust from the external sources but also through selfmobilization, by way of saving \nand sale of assets. Also, in case of microcredit, due to the definite obligation to repay \nthe  loan,  a  physical  collateral  may  sometimes  be  needed.  However,  the  biggest \nflexibility in the case of microfinance is the lack of any physical collateral, even in \ncase of loan from the bank. The options available with microfinance, therefore, are \nmuch broader and flexible than the ones available with microcredit \nThe Important Features of Microfinance  \n1.   Microfinance is a tool for the empowerment of poor women;  \n2.   Loans under microfinance programmes are very small;  \n3.   Microfinance targets the poor rural and urban households;  \n4.   Credit under microfinance follows thrift i.e. mobilize savings and lend the same;  \n5.   Low transaction cost due to group lendings;  \n6.   Transparencies in operation;  \n7.   Short repayment period;  \n8.   Simple procedure for reviewing, processing and approving loan applications and \ndelivery credit;  \n9.   Chances of misutilization are rare and there is assured repayment;  \n10.  Peer pressure act as the collateral security required for loans;  \n11.  Need based loan disbursement;  \n12.  Prompt repayment; and  \n13.  There is no ceiling from the RBI in respect of minimum and maximum amounts.

The popularity of the microfinance, \nself help groups stems from widespread recognition that formal banking channels are \nlargely ineffective in catering to the credit needs of the poor. Tiny savings and loans \nare generally an unattractive business proposition for formal banking institutions. In \naddition to disincentives faced by the banks, there are also problem faced by the poor \nin accessing loans from formal banking institutions. For example, to minimize risks, \nbanks demand, collateral security that the average micro borrower does not possess. \nBanks also insist on complicated procedures that are too time consuming and often \ntoo complicated for the poor and illiterate. Even in the implementation of direct \nlending programmes formal institutions find it difficult to overcome the problem of \ntargeting. The experience is that the rich and powerful typically manage to corner the \nscare loanable funds. Thus formal banking channels remain largely inaccessible to \nthe poor in India. As a result, the poor continue to be dependent on informal sector \nlending, paying exorbitant rates or underselling the product and their labour power to \nthe creditor.

Mutual fund is a collective investment vehicle which caters to the needs of \nsmall investors with lot of advantages. Similarly, investors with relatively higher \nfunds need professional management of the fund and for that they are ready to bear \nthe cost. For such investors, portfolio management services are provided.  \n   On the other hand, some people even do not have access to formal banking \nservices. They need these services at an affordable cost. Microfinance is an attempt \nin  this  direction.  Still  a  lot  needs  to  be  done  in this  aspect.  But  with  some \ncoordinated efforts from banks, post offices and other intermediations, India can \nachieve the target of financial inclusion of all the people in rural and remote area.  \n2.4 Terms

The  merger  was  completed  on  31  August  2018,  and  the \nnewly merged entity was named Vodafone Idea Limited. The merger created the \nlargest telecom company in India by subscribers and by revenue.

The Ranbaxy has been incurring a net loss and suffering \na decline in net worth since 2011. These include the settlement amount of US$ 515 \nmillion paid to the US Department of Justice (DOJ) in May 2013 after civil and \ncriminal  charges  were  brought  against  it  for misrepresentation of  data and \nirregularities found in two of its facilities in India, diminution in the value of its \ninvestments and a loss on foreign currency option derivatives.

Financial restructuring is not only a tool used by \ncompanies  that  are  in  financial  trouble.  Healthy  companies  may  also  choose  to \nrestructure their debt if it will provide a benefit. If interest rates fall, a company may \nrefinance its loans to take advantage of this drop. A strategic alliance is a relationship \nbetween two or more entities that agree to share resources to achieve a mutually \nbeneficial objective. Access to new market, new customers, to talent, new industry, \nnew technology and to reduce competition, cost of production and to enhance the \nbusiness are the major reasons for strategic alliance. \n   Though,  financial  crisis  is  the  main  reason  for  restructuring  the  company, \nhealthy companies may also choose to restructure their debt if it will provide a \nbenefit. \n3.4 Key words: \n1.

While  project  managers  are  not  required  to  conduct  the \nfeasibility study themselves, they use it as a guideline to drive the project and to get \nan end:to:end understanding of project parameters, business goals, and risk factors. \nWhat is a Feasibility Study? \n A  feasibility study  is  an  analysis  done  to  determine  the  viability  of  a  project \nfrom  an  economical,  legal,  and  technical  perspective.  Simply  put,  it  gives  us  an \ninsight into whether a project is doable or worth the investment. A feasibility study, \nthat’s well:designed, should offer insights on the description of the project, resource \nallocation,   accounting   statements,   financial   data, legal   requirements,   and   tax \nobligations. It helps to determine whether the project is both possible and profitable \nfor the company to undertake. Hence, this study is mandatorily done before technical \ndevelopment and project execution. \n ","metadata":{"source":"C:\\Users\\Vedant\\Documents\\Projects\\JPMC-CFG\\Team-2\\server\\assets\\dataset\\business_finance.pdf","pdf":{"version":"1.10.100","info":{"PDFFormatVersion":"1.4","IsAcroFormPresent":false,"IsXFAPresent":false,"Producer":"iLovePDF","ModDate":"D:20240615143501Z"},"metadata":null,"totalPages":344},"loc":{"pageNumber":309}}}],["332a6727-eb2b-4ffc-95d6-c307cb8e9649",{"pageContent":" \n311\nTypes of Feasibility Studies \nThere are five types of feasibility studies based on the area that is examined: \n1.   Technical Feasibility \n This study takes stock of the technical resources available to undertake a project \nfrom  an  organization’s  perspective.  It  includes  ensuring  that  the  technical  resources \nare  adequate,  and  the  hardware  and  software  requirements  are  met.  Technical \nfeasibility  will  also  include  if  proven  technologies  and  methodologies  exist  to \nsupport the proposed development. \n2.   Economic Feasibility \n This  assessment  performs  a  cost/  benefits  analysis  of  the  project  before  the \nfinancial resources are allocated. This type of study gives a clear:cut idea of project \ncredibility  (viability)  as  well  as  the  economic  benefits  to  the  organization  from  the \nproject. \n3.   Legal Feasibility \n In  this  type  of  feasibility  study,  the  legal  requirements  of  the  proposed  project \nare analyzed. Several parameters, ranging from zonal laws to data protection acts are \nchecked, and compliance mandates are mapped out. \n4.   Operational Feasibility \n This study will help analyze and determine whether the organization’s goals can \nbe satisfied by completing the project. \n5.   Scheduling Feasibility \n This is the most important assessment for project success.  It estimates the time \nnecessary  to  complete  the  project  after  considering  the  organization’s  capabilities \nand determines whether that amount of time is available. \nBenefits of a Feasibility Study \n1.

Market  research: This  is  an  essential  factor,  as  no  project  is  begun  without \nadequate  market  research.  A  thorough  analysis  of  the  existing  market  and \ncompetition is done to manage the project accordingly. \n4. Financial assessment: In this stage, all the costs related to the project, including \nequipment,  man:hours,  the  financial  risks,  and  the benefits  associated  with  the \nproject are estimated and scrutinized. \n5. Alternative solutions: Whenever  any  hiccups  arise,  the  team  should  be  well:\nprepared  to  come  up  with  a  solution.  This  is  an  integral  yet  dynamic  part  of  a \nfeasibility study. \n6.

If  something  is viable,  it  means  that  it  can  work \nsuccessfully. If a company is viable, it means that we expect it to make a profit year \nafter year. \n Viable  refers  to  anything  or  any  situation  which  can  carry  on  developing, \ngrowing, advancing, or thriving. \n The  word  viability,  a  mass  noun,  refers  to  something’s  ability  or  capacity  to \nwork successfully. It could be a proposal, idea, project, or even a plan to change how \na company does business. \n A viability study tries to determine whether something is viable. \nViability study vs. feasibility study \n People often use the two terms interchangeably. However, they do not have the \nsame meaning. \nFeasibility study \n A  feasibility  study  is  an  assessment  of  how  practical  or  doable  a  proposed \nmethod  or  plan  is.  It  is  an  analysis  that  tries  to find  out  whether  it  is  possible  to \ncomplete a project, successfully. \nViability study \n A  viability  study  is  an  investigation  into  a  business  idea.  Specifically,  whether \nthe idea will make money? i.e. whether it will be profitable or not? \n The viability study is not about whether something is doable, but rather whether \nit is worth doing. \n Simply;  a  feasibility  study  looks  at  whether  something  can  be  done,  while  a \nviability study looks at whether it is worth doing. \n However, a growing number of feasibility studies today also include an analysis \nof the expected profitability of a project or idea. \n A number of appraisal methods may be recommended for evaluating the capital \nexpenditure   proposals   or   projects.

Unlike \nearnings or net income, free cash flow is a measure of profitability that excludes the \nnon:cash expenses of the income statement and includes spending on equipment and \nassets  as  well  as  changes  in  working  capital from  the  balance  sheet.  Interest \npayments  are  excluded  from  the  generally  accepted  definition  of  free  cash  flow. \nInvestment  bankers  and  analysts  who  need  to  evaluate  a  company’s  expected \nperformance with different capital structures will use variations of free cash flow like \nfree  cash  flow  for  the  firm  and  free  cash  flow  to equity,   which  are  adjusted  for \ninterest payments and borrowings. \n Similar  to  sales  and  earnings,  free  cash  flow  is  often  evaluated  on  a  per  share \nbasis   to   evaluate   the   effect   of   dilution. Free   cash   flow   (FCF) is   the   cash   a \ncompany generates  after  taking  into  consideration  cash  outflows  that  support  its \noperations and maintain its capital assets. In other words, free cash flow is the cash \nleft over after a company pays for its operating expenses and capital expenditures. It \nis the money that remains after paying for items such as payroll, rent, and taxes, and \na  company  can  use  it  as  it  pleases.  Knowing  how  to calculate  free  cash  flow  and \nanalyze it will help a company with its cash management  and will provide investors \nwith  insight  into  a  company's  financials,  helping  them  make  better  investment \ndecisions. Free cash flow is an important measurement since it shows how efficient a \ncompany  is at  generating  cash.  Investors  use  free  cash  flow  to  measure  whether  a \ncompany might have enough cash, after funding operations and capital expenditures, \nto  pay  investors  through  dividends  or  share  buybacks.   In  addition,  the  more  free \ncash  flow  a  company  has,  the  better  it  is  placed  to  pay  down  debt  and  pursue \nopportunities  that  can  enhance  its  business,  making  it  an  attractive  choice  for \ninvestors. This article will cover how a company calculates free cash flow and how \nto interpret that free cash flow number to choose good investments that will generate \na return on your capital. \nFeatures of Free Cash Flow\u0007 \n• Free  cash  flow  (FCF)  is  the  money  a  company  has  left  over  after  paying  its \noperating expenses and capital expenditures.

Regardless of the method \nused,  the  final  number  should  be  the  same  given  the  information  a  company \nprovides. The three ways in which to calculate free cash flow are by using operating \ncash flow, using sales revenue, and using net operating profits. \n1. Using Operating Cash Flow \n Using  operating  cash  flow  to  calculate  free  cash  flow  is  the  most  common \nmethod  because  it  is  the  simplest  and  uses  two  numbers  that  are  readily  found  in \nfinancial statements: operating cash flow and capital expenditures. To calculate FCF, \nlocate the item cash flow from operations (also referred to as \"operating cash\" or \"net \ncash  from  operating  activities\")  from  the  cash  flow  statement and  subtract  capital \nexpenditure, which is found on the income statement. \nThe formula is: \nFree Cash Flow= Operating Cash Flow −Capital Expenditures \n2. Using Sales Revenue \n Using sales revenue focuses on the revenue that a company generates through its \nbusiness and then subtracting the costs associated with generating that revenue. This \nmethod utilizes the income statement and balance sheet as the source of information. \nTo calculate FCF, locate sales or revenue on the income statement, subtract the sum \nof  taxes  and  all  operating  costs  (or  listed  as  \"operating  expenses\"),  which  include \nitems  such  as  cost  of  goods  sold   (COGS)  and  selling,  general  and  administrative ","metadata":{"source":"C:\\Users\\Vedant\\Documents\\Projects\\JPMC-CFG\\Team-2\\server\\assets\\dataset\\business_finance.pdf","pdf":{"version":"1.10.100","info":{"PDFFormatVersion":"1.4","IsAcroFormPresent":false,"IsXFAPresent":false,"Producer":"iLovePDF","ModDate":"D:20240615143501Z"},"metadata":null,"totalPages":344},"loc":{"pageNumber":314}}}],["5bbfc679-75ab-47a2-94a7-b5a243cba5ea",{"pageContent":" \n316\ncosts  (SG&A).

Amortization and Depreciation \n To  calculate  free  cash  flow another  way, locate the  income  statement  and \nbalance  sheet.  Start  with net  income and  add  back  charges  for  depreciation  and \namortization. Make an additional adjustment for changes in working capital, which is \ndone  by  subtracting  current  liabilities  from  current  assets.  Then  subtract  capital \nexpenditure (or spending on plants and equipment): \nNet Income + Depreciation/ Amortization\u0007 Change in Working Capital\u0007 Capital \nExpenditure= Free Cash Flow \n It  might  seem  odd  to  add  back  depreciation/amortization  since  it  accounts  for \ncapital spending. The reasoning behind the adjustment is that free cash flow is meant \nto measure money being spent right now, not transactions that happened in the past. \nThis  makes  FCF  a  useful  instrument  for  identifying growing  companies  with  high \nup:front  costs,  which  may  eat  into  earnings  now  but  have  the  potential  to  pay  off \nlater. \nFree Cash Flow Benefits \n Free  cash  flow  can  provide  a  significant  amount  of  insight  into  the  financial \nhealth  of a company. Because free cash flow is made up of a variety of components \nin the financial statement, understanding its composition can provide investors with a \nlot of useful information. \n Of  course,  the  higher  the  free  cash  flow  the  better.  But  we  have  already  seen \nfrom  our  Macy's  example  that  a  declining  free  cash flow  is  not  always  bad  if  the \nreason is from further investments in the company that poise it to reap larger rewards \ndown the line. \n In  addition,  cash  flow  from  operations  takes  into consideration  increases  and \ndecreases  in  assets  and  liabilities,  allowing  for  a  deeper  understanding  of  free  cash \nflow. So for example, if account payable continued to decrease, it would signify that \na  company  is  paying  its  suppliers  faster.  If  accounts  receivable was  decreasing,  it \nwould mean that a company is receiving payments from its customers faster. \n Now,  if  accounts  payable  was  decreasing  because  suppliers  wanted  to  be  paid \nquicker  but  accounts  receivable  was  increasing  because  customers  weren't  paying ","metadata":{"source":"C:\\Users\\Vedant\\Documents\\Projects\\JPMC-CFG\\Team-2\\server\\assets\\dataset\\business_finance.pdf","pdf":{"version":"1.10.100","info":{"PDFFormatVersion":"1.4","IsAcroFormPresent":false,"IsXFAPresent":false,"Producer":"iLovePDF","ModDate":"D:20240615143501Z"},"metadata":null,"totalPages":344},"loc":{"pageNumber":316}}}],["eab33cad-327b-40eb-8d88-baef29fa243f",{"pageContent":" \n318\nquickly  enough,  this  could  result  in  decreased  free  cash  flow,  since  money  is  not \ncoming  in  quickly  enough  to  meet  the  money  going  out,  which  could  result  in \nproblems for the company down the line. \n The overall benefits of a high free cash flow, however, mean that a company is \nable   to   pay   its   debts,   contribute   to   growth,   share its   success   with   its \nshareholders through dividends, and has prospects for a successful future. \nFree Cash Flow Limitations \n One  drawback  to  using  the  free  cash  flow method  is  that capital  expenditures \ncan vary dramatically from year to year and between different industries. That's why \nit's  critical  to  measure  FCF  over  multiple  periods and  against  the  backdrop  of  a \ncompany's industry.  \n It's important to note that an exceedingly high FCF might be an indication that a \ncompany  is  not  investing  in  its business  properly, such  as  updating  its  plant  and \nequipment.  Conversely,  negative  FCF  might  not  necessarily  mean  a  company  is  in \nfinancial  trouble,  but  rather,  investing  heavily  in  expanding its  market  share,  which \nwould likely lead to future growth. \n Value investors often look for companies with high or improving cash flows but \nwith  undervalued  share  prices.  Rising  cash  flow  is often  seen  as  an  indicator \nthat future growth is likely. \n4.2.3 Concept of Net Present Value: \n As an organization expands, it needs to take important decisions which involve \nimmense  capital  investment.  An  organization  must  take  the  decisions  regarding  the \nexpansion  of  business  and  investment  very  wisely.  In  such  cases,  the  organization \nwill take assistance of Capital Budgeting tools, one of the most popular NPV method \nand take a call on the most profitable investment. \n Net present value is a tool of Capital budgeting to analyze the profitability of a \nproject  or  investment.  It  is  calculated  by  taking  the  difference  between  the  present \nvalue of cash inflows and present value of cash outflows over a period of time. \n Net  present  value  (NPV)  is  a  financial  metric  that  seeks  to  capture  the  total \nvalue of a potential investment opportunity.

The resulting \nnumber  after  adding  all  the  positive  and  negative  cash  flows  together  is  the \ninvestment’s NPV. A positive NPV means that, after accounting for the time value of \nmoney, you will make money if you proceed with the investment. \n Cash inflows are discounted to their present value and then compared with the \ncapital outlay required by the investment.  \n The interest rate used in discounting is the required minimum rate of return.   \n Proposal is acceptable when NPV is zero or positive.  \n The higher the positive NPV, the more attractive the investment \n Net Present Value is the excess of present value of total cash inflows over the \ninitial investment. Thus,  \nNPV= Discounted value of cash inflows – Initial Investment \n As  the  name  suggests,  net  present  value  is  nothing  but  net  off  of  the  present \nvalue of cash inflows and outflows by discounting the flows at a specified rate. \nFormula for NPV \nNPV = (Cash flows)/( 1+r)^t \nCash flows= Cash flows in the time period \nr  = Discount rate \nt = time period \n As seen in the formula – To derive the present value of the cash flows we need \nto  discount  them  at  a  particular  rate.

The time value of money \nsimply  means  that  a  rupee  today  is  of  more  value  today  than  it  will  be  tomorrow. \nNPV helps in deciding whether it is worth to take up a project basis the present value \nof the cash flows. \n After discounting the cash flows over different periods, the initial investment is \ndeducted from it.

If  a  higher  rate  of  return  is  assumed,  it  can  show  false  negative  NPV, \nalso if a lower rate of return is taken it will show the false profitability of the project \nand hence result in wrong decision making. \n2. Different projects are not comparable \n NPV cannot be used to compare two projects which are not of the same period. \nConsidering the fact that many  businesses have  a fixed budget  and sometimes have \ntwo project options,  NPV cannot be used for comparing the two projects different in \nperiod of time or risk involved in the projects. \n3. Multiple Assumptions \n The NPV method also makes a lot of assumptions in terms of inflows, outflows. \nThere might be a lot of expenditure that will come to surface only when the project \nactually takes off.  Also the inflows may not always be as expected.

With  all  its  limitations,  the  NPV  method  in  capital  budgeting  is \nvery useful and hence is widely used.   \n4.2.4 Profitability Index: \n This technique is also known as ‘Cost Benefit Ratio’ if profitability index is less \nthan one then the proposal is rejected.  \nProfitability Index (PI) Rule \n The  profitability  index  rule  is  a  decision:making exercise  that  helps  evaluate \nwhether  to  proceed  with  a  project.  The  index  itself  is  a  calculation  of  the  potential \nprofit  of  the  proposed  project.  The  rule  is  that  a profitability  index  or  ratio  greater \nthan 1 indicates that the project should proceed. A profitability index or ratio below 1 \nindicates that the project should be abandoned. \nFormula: \nProfitability Index = Present Value of Cash Inflows / Present Value of Initial \nInvestment \n The formula for PI is the present value of future cash flows divided by the initial \ncost of the project. \n The  PI  rule  is  that  a  result  above  1  indicates  a  go,  while  a  result  under  1  is  a \nloser. \n The PI rule is a variation of the NPV rule. \nUnderstanding the Profitability Index Rule \n The profitability index is calculated by dividing the present value of future cash \nflows  that  will  be  generated  by  the  project  by  the initial  cost  of  the  project.  A \nprofitability index of 1 indicates that the project will break even. If it is less than 1, \nthe costs outweigh the benefits. If it is above 1, the venture should be profitable. \n For example, if a project costs Rs.10, 000 and will return Rs.12, 000, it's a \"go.\" \nPI vs. NPV \n The profitability index rule is a variation of the net present value (NPV) rule. In \ngeneral, a positive NPV will correspond with a profitability index that is greater than \none. A negative NPV will correspond with a profitability index that is below one.

An investment can either have a \nshort or long payback period. A shorter payback period means the investment will be \n‘repaid’  fairly  shortly,  in  other  words,  the  cost  of  that  investment  will  quickly  be \nrecovered  by  the  cash  flow  that  investment  will  generate.  Typically,  a  shorter \npayback  period  is  considered  better,  since  it  means  the  investment’s  risk  level \nassociated  with  the  initial  investment  cost  is  only  for  a  shorter  period  of  time.  In \norder to determine whether the payback period is favourable or not, management will \ndetermine  the  maximum  desired  payback  period  to  recover  the  initial  investment \ncosts.  Depending  on  the  calculated  payback  period  of  a  project,  management  can \ndecide to either accept or reject the project. An investment project will be accepted if \nthe  payback  period  is  less  than  or  equal  to  the  management's  maximum  desired \npayback period. \nFeatures of Payback period  \n Payback  period  is  a  simple  calculation  of  time  for  the  initial  investment  to \nreturn. It ignores the time value of money.  All other techniques of capital budgeting \nconsider  the  concept  of  time  value  of  money.  Time  value  of  money  means  that  a \nrupee  today  is  more  valuable  than  a  rupee  tomorrow.  So  other  techniques  discount \nthe future inflows and arrive at discounted flows. It is used in combination with other \ntechniques of capital budgeting. Owing to its simplicity the payback period cannot be \nthe only technique used for deciding the project to be selected.   \nPayback period example \n Payback  period  is  usually  expressed  in  years.

Payback period \u0007 even cash inflows \n If cash inflows from the project are even, then the payback period is calculated \nby taking the initial investment cost divided by the annual cash inflow. \n For example: Company A wants to invest in a new project.

To  accomplish  this  objective, it  tries  to  procure  the  desired \nmaterial  for  the  operation  of  its  plant  at  a  low  cost.  It  has  usually  the  alternative  of \nsatisfying its requirements by producing the  goods or material from within the firm \nitself. \n In  some  cases,  a  firm  can  manufacture  materials  in  the  desired  quantity  at  a \nrelatively  low  cost;  but  in  certain  other  cases,  the  procurement  of  these  goods  from \noutsiders is more advantageous. In determining whether goods or material should be \npurchased or produced within the firm arises the “make or buy” problem. \n The   policies   of   the   firms   vary   considerably   in   make   or   buy   decision \nconsiderably. There are certain industries which follow the policy of self:support to \nthe extent of manufacturing all the items required by them. On the other hand, there \nare  concerns  which  believe  in  procuring  material  from  other  companies  that \nspecialize in the manufacture of those items/products. \n Every  company  uses  a  variety  of  suppliers  and  services;  they  need  stationery, \ncartons, polyethylene bags, detergents, chemicals, power, heat, and many others. But \nit  is  not  possible  for  them  to  procure  all  of  them or  produce  all  of  them.  They, \ntherefore,  take  decisions  on  which  items  they  should  make  and  which  goods  and \nservices they should buy. \nFactors influencing “Make or Buy” decision: \n The following are some of the factors influencing make or buy decisions. \n1.   Size of the company influence Make or Buy decision \n The sizes of a  concern have  a  greater influence on Make or  Buy  decision. The \ndecisions are taken on the basis of their financial implications for a growing concern. \n For small companies, with an annual expenditure of a few lakhs of rupees, it is \nalways desirable to buy materials from outside. \n In big concerns, where a substantial amount is involved, a full:scale analysis is \nrequired  covering  company  matters  relating  to  overall  corporate  policy,  direct  cost, \npersonnel  relations,  plant  layout,  and  other  details  which  are  incidental  to  any \nmanufacturing programme.

Difficulties in Manufacturing \n Manufacturing  may  be  undertaken  to  ensure  a  regular  supply.  This  is  specially \nnecessary  where  a  close  coordination  between  demand  and  supply  is  required.  The \ndecision to make goods appears to be quite attractive from the point of view of self:\nsufficiency,  the  high  cost  of  procurement,  and  the interruptions  in  deliveries  by \nvendors confronted with labor difficulties or natural calamities. It has been said that \nthe difficulties which manufacturers are trying to avoid to arise even when they buy \nmaterial  for  their  own  production.  But  the  danger  is  less,  for  there  is  a  greater \nassurance of regular supply, when the item is manufactured by the user himself. \n3.   Quality of goods \n In some  cases, the decision to make flows  from the company’s expectations to \nhave  goods  of  a  desired  quality.  It  has  been  observed  that,  in  a  seller’s  market, \nvendors  do  not  bother  about  quality  and  specifications.  Sometimes  they  sell  only \nhigh quality goods and enjoy a profitable sales volume; they do not, therefore, have \nany  interest  in  lower  quality  goods  which  at  times may  be  needed  by  some \nmanufacturers. In such a situation, the producer has no option but to manufacture the \ngoods himself. \n4.   Profit factor \n There  are  conditions  under  which  it  is  profitable for  a  company  to  produce \ncertain items more economically than they can be bought from outside. If it discovers \na new process which enables it to produce some items at a definitely low cost or if it \nacquires equipment at a relatively low price that can manufacture goods cheaply, the \ndecision to make goods instead of buying them will be quite profitable. \n5.   Capacity to manufacture \n Capacity  of  a  firm  to  manufacture  materials  also  affects  the  make  or  buy \ndecision.  During  the  period  of  depression  or  recession,  the  manufacturer  with  idle \nplant capacity may find it desirable to undertake the production of those goods which \nthey were formerly buying. Even during normal times, the decision to make is taken \nwith  a  view  to  increasing  the  total  volume  of  production.  In  this  way,  the  overhead \ncosts  can  be  distributed.  Sometimes,  protection  of quality  design  also  tempts \ncompanies to make decisions. \n ","metadata":{"source":"C:\\Users\\Vedant\\Documents\\Projects\\JPMC-CFG\\Team-2\\server\\assets\\dataset\\business_finance.pdf","pdf":{"version":"1.10.100","info":{"PDFFormatVersion":"1.4","IsAcroFormPresent":false,"IsXFAPresent":false,"Producer":"iLovePDF","ModDate":"D:20240615143501Z"},"metadata":null,"totalPages":344},"loc":{"pageNumber":333}}}],["b8446383-2c40-42d9-9fc8-3bf0d7fb399c",{"pageContent":" \n335\nGuidelines to “Make or Buy” policy: \n The following are often an answer to most “make or buy” decisions relating to \nsupplies and services: \n1.    When a dependable source does not exist outside, it is desirable for the company \nto   produce   the   goods   of   the   desired   quality,   unless   some   unforeseen \ncircumstances  develop.  For  instance,  most  big  companies  prefer  to  have  their \nown thermal supply because public power plants are not reliable. \n2.    When   a   dependable   source   exists   outside   which   provides   goods   at   an \neconomical  price,  it  should  be  used,  unless  there  is  a  strong  case  for  not  doing \nso.

Some schemes grant financial security while\nothers aim to provide socio-economic measures.\nThe beneficiaries covered under most of the individual schemes are the rural people,\nurban poor, low-income families, economically backward sections or weaker sections\nof the society. Generally, the meaning of a scheme is a plan, design, or program of\naction involving many people which is formulated by the government. The different\nMinistries of the Government of India have launched various government programmes\nknown as schemes or Yojana.\nThe Government has set up several schemes to improve the lives of communities and\nindividuals who have been treated unequally for several centuries. These schemes are\nto ensure greater opportunity for people who have not had this in the past.\n15.2 FINANCIAL SCHEMES OF GOVERNMENT OF\nINDIA\nThe salient features of the important Government Sponsored Socially Oriented Insurance\nSchemes are enumerated below:\n15.2.1 Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana (PMJDY)\nPradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana program under the National Mission for Financial\nInclusion was launched initially for a period of 4 years on August 28, 2014. It envisages\nuniversal access to banking facilities with at least one basic banking account for every\nhousehold, financial literacy, access to credit, insurance and pension. Later, the\nGovernment extended the comprehensive PMJDY program with the modification in\nthe accidental insurance cover wherein accidental insurance cover for new RuPay\ncard holders is raised from existing one lakh rupees to two lakh rupees, to new PMJDY\naccounts opened after August 28, 2018.\nWhile launching the scheme, it was referred to the ancient Sanskrit verse: Sukhasya\nMoolam Dharma, Dharmasya Moolam Artha, Arthasya Moolam Rajyam - which puts\nthe onus on the state to involve people in economic activity. Under this, a person not\nhaving a savings account can open an account without the requirement of any minimum\nbalance and, in case they self-certify that they do not have any of the officially valid\ndocuments required for opening a savings account, they may open a small account.\nFurther, to expand the reach of banking services, all over 6 lakh villages in the country\nwere mapped into 1.59 lakh Sub Service Areas (SSAs), with each SSA typically\ncomprising of 1,000 to 1,500 households, and in the 1.26 lakh SSAs that did not have\na bank branch, Bank Mitras were deployed for branchless banking.\nThus, PMJDY offers unbanked persons easy access to banking services and awareness\nabout financial products through financial literacy programmes. In addition, they receive\na RuPay debit card, with inbuilt accident insurance cover of Rs. 2 lakh, and access to\noverdraft facility upon satisfactory operation of account or credit history of six months.\nFurther, through Prime Minister’s Social Security Schemes, launched by the Hon’ble\nPrime Minister on 9th May 2015, all eligible account holders can access through their\nbank accounts, personal accident insurance cover under Pradhan Mantri Suraksha","metadata":{"source":"C:\\Users\\Vedant\\Documents\\Projects\\JPMC-CFG\\Team-2\\server\\assets\\dataset\\government_schemes.pdf","pdf":{"version":"1.10.100","info":{"PDFFormatVersion":"1.6","IsAcroFormPresent":false,"IsXFAPresent":false,"Producer":"fCoder PDF producer","CreationDate":"D:20230410120518+05'30'","ModDate":"D:20230410120650+05'30'"},"metadata":{"_metadata":{"xmp:modifydate":"2023-04-10T12:06:50+05:30","xmp:createdate":"2023-04-10T12:05:18+05:30","xmp:metadatadate":"2023-04-10T12:06:50+05:30","dc:format":"application/pdf","xmpmm:documentid":"uuid:6cbd7328-d0b5-48aa-8211-b128f58d9703","xmpmm:instanceid":"uuid:e153bd73-1f7c-4b82-8304-890c4bc61533","pdf:producer":"fCoder PDF producer"}},"totalPages":18},"loc":{"pageNumber":2}}}],["5d7a53c5-0c7d-4702-b9b8-321824564c86",{"pageContent":"345\nFinancial  Schemes  of\nGovernment of India\nBima Yojana, life insurance cover under Pradhan Mantri Jeevan Jyoti Bima Yojana,\nand guaranteed minimum pension to subscribers under Atal Pension Yojana.\nObjectives\nObjective of “Pradhan Mantri Jan-Dhan Yojana (PMJDY)” is ensuring access to various\nfinancial services like availability of basic savings bank account, access to need based\ncredit, remittances facility, insurance and pension to the excluded sections i.e. weaker\nsections & low income groups.

They often, hear them talk about saving for buying another car, new \nmodel  of television,  double-door  refrigerator,  latest  model  of  washing  machine  and  so \non. There seems to be a never ending list and nobody seems to agree upon any purchase \nof  a  particular  item.  The  children  desire  an LCD  television  set,  their  mother  wants  a \nrefrigerator  while  father  wants  to  possess  a  new  car  and  grandparents  want  to  deposit \nmoney in the bank to be used at a later date. The priorities of the family members differ \nin terms of their needs, utility and the price of various household items. However, all of \nthem are making a choice which has financial implications for the family. The option will \nrequire  a  careful  analysis  of  the  families’  income,  expenses  and  savings.  Since  the \namount  of  money  available  with  the  family  is  limited,  some  purchases  may  have  to  be \ndeferred or postponed to a future date. Therefore, it would be appropriate if they decide \nin advance what to buy keeping in view  their income and expenses. They take a decision \nto purchase a car as it would serve the interest of all and everyone will enjoy its benefits.  \n \nAll of us at some time or the other have taken major and minor financial decisions in \nour life. Your parents may  have asked  you to choose between  going for  a school trip or \npurchase a  new  computer  game.    The  school  trip  may  cost `. 3000/- and  the  computer \ngame `. 3500/-.  Even if you do not have any income you have been involved in financial \ndecision making.  Sometimes your parents may have deferred buying  you a new bicycle \nbecause  their  house  loan  instalment  had  to  be  paid.  We are  all  part  of  the  financial \ndecision  making  process and are affected by our family’s financial situation.  You have \nobserved in your daily life that spending, financing, investing are becoming part of your \nroutine  activities.    These  decisions  are  all  components  of  personal  finance.

Usually, some money is kept aside for this if it is surplus.  In the middle income \ngroups,  there  may  be  little  or  no  savings  due  to  high  prices  of  essential  items.    This  is \nwhere it becomes important to think of a personal financial plan.  In contrast in advanced \ncountries,  like  America,  individuals  tend  to  rely  too  much  on  credit  cards which \nsometimes puts them in debt.  They do not think of saving money and usually spend all \ntheir monthly income. Despite the difference in the cultural as well as economic position \nof the countries all individuals need to plan their finances in order to have some surplus \nand avoid debt.  \n \nWhen people or households do not have any savings, it becomes problematic in difficult \ntimes or  emergencies like  paying  for  hospital  expenses,  repairs  in  case  of  accident  or \nother  necessities.    Similarly,  if  you  have  savings then  there  are  numerous  options to \nchannelise  your  savings  such  as  like bank deposits,  insurance  plans,  shares etc. Thus, \nbeing financially prepared for such exigencies makes life much easier. Once  you have  a \nfinancial plan, a lot of financial issues relating to savings and expenses get streamlined.  \n \nWhy Personal Finance \nThe main  purpose of  personal  finance  education  is  to  positively  influence  financial \nbehaviour.  It  has  been  observed  that  such  education  is  delivered  more  effectively  to \nyounger  children  than  to  their  older  counterparts.

When you  spend  money  on  a  particular thing  you  are  giving  up \nsomething  else.    For  example,  if  you  purchase  a  book  for `. 500/- you  are  sacrificing \nmaybe,  a  video  game  of  the  same  amount  or  you  could  have saved  that  money  for  the \nfuture.

Financial  advisors  usually \ngive  you  advice  and  guide  you  on  your  savings  and  investment.    They  may  sometimes \nmake   false   claims   and   guarantee   high   returns   on   particular   investments.      Your \nunderstanding of personal finance will enable you to determine whether their advice is in \nyour best interests or theirs. \nBecome a financial advisor \nThere  are  many  people  who  do  not  understand  financial  matters  or  are  not  interested  in \ntaking  financial  decisions  at  all.    At  times,  many  employees  go  on  paying  high  taxes \nbecause they do not know that by investing in certain securities or  contributing to their \nprovident funds they may save on taxes.  There is a demand for financial advisors and a \ncourse  in  personal  finance  or  other  finance  related  courses  can  help  you  pursue  a  career \nas  a  financial  advisor.    They  usually  charge  a  commission  on  the  amount  of  investment \nmade  from  the  source  of  the  securities,  for  example,  the  post  office  or the  company \nconnected with the mutual funds. At a later stage, if they are enterprising and have a good \nunderstanding of financial matters they get paid for their specialised knowledge. \nInstilling Financial Discipline \nAll  of  us  need  to  be  disciplined  when  it  comes  to  spending  money.  If  you  have  to  live \nwith a limited income your expenses have to be  regulated. Same is true  for  your pocket \nmoney; you have to make sure your money lasts through the whole month.

One  cannot \nexpect  to  have  same  financial  plan  as  another  even  if  two  people  are  earning  the  same \nsalary. This is because financial situations and risk taking ability are different. Suppose a \nperson already has to pay a housing loan instalment (EMI) and take care of other personal \nresponsibilities, then his risk taking ability would be much lower than a person who does \nnot have to repay a loan. \nHow exactly do you go about preparing a financial plan? \n Assess  your  finances.  Make  a  list  of  your  bank  accounts,  investments, fixed \ndeposits, mutual funds, shares etc.  \n What  are  your  expenses  per  month?  How  much  do  you  spend on  rents  or \ninstalments  (EMIs),  your  kids’ education,  monthly  kitchen  expenses  and  so  on. \nYou  will  be  able  to  understand  where  you  are  with  respect  to  your  income, \nexpenses and savings. \n Now  the  next  step  would  be  to  list  down  your  goals  which  could  be  short  term, \nmedium term or long term. \nYour  short-term  goals  could  be  buying  a  car  or  going  on  a vacation,  let  us \npresume in the next 5 years. \nYour  medium-term  goals  could  be  your  child’s education,  buying  a  house, or \nsetting up your own business.

You \nmay  use  your  saving  for  investing  in bank  deposits  or  in  the  financial  markets  or \npurchasing an asset such as a car or paying off your loan.  Budgeting is a process where \nyou  evaluate  your  current  financial  position  by  assessing  your  income,  expenses,  assets \nand  liabilities.    Your  budget  is  influenced  by  your  income  because  you  can  only  spend \nwhat you earn.

Credit card \nfacilities should be used less as interest rates are exorbitant.  It is normally used to cover \nexpenses that cannot be covered by current income. \n \nFinancing large purchases \nHuge expenditures like  purchase of a car or a house often  are financed  by  a loan.   How \nmuch  loan  to  take  will  depend  upon  your  savings  and  the  purchase  price  of  the assets.  \nThe capacity to repay the loan is also an important consideration.  Loans are available in \neasy instalment of monthly, six monthly or annual system of repayment.  The interest rate \ncharged  also  is  different  for  different  schemes  of  loan  and  its  repayment.  There  are, \ntherefore, four things to consider: (i) how much loan to take, (ii) Maturity or length of the \nloan (iii) Interest rate  and (iv) Instalment plan. \n \nProtecting  assets \nInsurance plans are available to protect your assets.  Insurance companies offer different \ntypes of insurance policies with varying amounts of premium to be paid depending on the \nrisk associated.  Car insurance, house insurance, health insurance are some of the popular \npolicies for different amounts. \n \nInvesting money \nThe  extra  funds which  you  have  can  be  invested  in  shares,  bonds,  mutual  funds  and \nproperty  to  earn  a  higher  return.    You  may  invest  your  saving  in  bank  deposits  for \ndifferent periods with varied rates of interest if you wish to opt for a safe investment.

It is only the net cash flows which \nenhance your wealth since you can save it or invest it further to earn a higher income. \n \nCash Inflows \nYour income is the major source of cash inflows.  Your qualifications and the stage at which you \nare  in  are  the  two  factors  affecting  your  income  level. Then  other  sources  are interest  income, \ndividend, rent from property etc. \nStage in career path  \nPeople  at  initial  stages  of  their  career  earn  a  lower  salary.    As  they  grow  and  develop  in  their \ncareer,  their  salaries increase,  allowances increase,  their  experience  enables  them  to  get  other \nhigher  post  jobs, etc.    This  normally  has  a  direct  correlation with  your  age.    The  older  you  get \nyour salary structure and status improve.  But it may so happen that when jobs are changed  older \npeople do not get the commensurate salary.  Your cash inflows or your salary therefore depends \nupon your career and the stage of your career. \nType of job \nSome jobs are very well paid.  In India, professionals or people with specialized skills earn much \nmore. Engineers,  management  professionals,  lawyers,  are  usually  paid higher salaries.    Doctors \nwho  are  also highly  qualified,  unfortunately,  in India,  are  not  well  paid.    If  you  are  self \nemployed,  then  your  cash  inflows  will  depend  upon the hard  work  and  the  time, energy  and \ndedication you put into your work. \nNumber of working people in your household \nThe households’ cash inflows    also  depends upon  the  other  earning  members  in  the  household.  \nObviously,  the  household  with  more  than  one  income  earner  will  be  more  comfortable  and  the \ntotal cash inflows will increase. \n \nCash Outflows \nCash  outflows  are the  expenses  incurred  on  various  items and assets.    These    depend  upon  the \nperson’s family size, age and consumption patterns. \n \n ","metadata":{"source":"C:\\Users\\Vedant\\Documents\\Projects\\JPMC-CFG\\Team-2\\server\\assets\\dataset\\personal_finance.pdf","pdf":{"version":"1.10.100","info":{"PDFFormatVersion":"1.6","IsAcroFormPresent":false,"IsXFAPresent":false,"Producer":"iLovePDF","ModDate":"D:20240615143354Z"},"metadata":null,"totalPages":114},"loc":{"pageNumber":12}}}],["e8823e95-fc25-4f67-93b2-7015fca214ec",{"pageContent":" 13 \nFamily size \nIf you are the only earning member and supporting a large family, then expenses will be high.  It \nalso  depends  upon  the  number  of  school  going  children  where  high  fees  are  to  be  paid, \nexpenditure on clothing, transport, etc., will also be high. Where the numbers of dependants are \nless, expenses are lower and these households normally have a capacity to save. \nAge \nAs  people  grow  older  their  expenses  change  and  they  may  tend  to  spend on  assets like  cars, \nhouses, land, etc.  Their expenditure on school tuition fees, household items decreases and they \nhave more cash to spare for purchasing a house or a car or going for vacations abroad.  And then \nthey may still have some money to spare for investing. \nPersonal consumption patterns \nPeople have different consumption patterns, some like to spend extravagantly and spend most of \ntheir money on expensive things  as soon as they get their salary.  Middle class families usually \nspend their money in the beginning of the month and they are left with little to save.  Then there \nare some people who are always saving for some contingency or some dream house they want to \nbuy.    Their  expenditure  is  the  bare  minimum  but  their  savings  are  large.    Cash  flows  will \ntherefore    depend    upon    consumption    behaviour.        Savings    will    also    depend    on    a \nfamily’s/individual’s  consumption  pattern  and  spending.    Consumption  pattern  is  also  affected \nby  the  amount  you  have  to  spend.    The  income  you  earn  will  determine  your  consumption \nbehaviour like if there are two persons earning in the family, that household  spends more. \n \nPreparing a Budget \nIn the personal cash flow statement, we recorded actual income, expenses and savings.

This  cash  flow  statement  based  on  forecast \nincome and expenses for a future time period is called a budget.   \n \nA budget may be prepared to determine whether your income (cash inflows) will be sufficient to \ntake  care  of  the  expenses  (cash  outflow)  that  you  are  likely  to  incur  in  the  next  month.

An  emergency  fund  could  also  be \ncreated and some money kept aside for such purposes. \nAssessing the accuracy of the budget \nSince  a  budget  is  a  statement  of  anticipated  cash  inflows  and  outflows,  it  will  be  generally \nprudent  to  compare  the  actual  cash  flows  with  forecast  cash  flows.    Usually,  we  tend  to \noverestimate cash inflows (income) and underestimate a cash outflows (expenses), as a result the \nnet cash flows are less than expected.  Budgeting, therefore, helps us to limit our spending so as \nto adjust to the limited income inflows.  Or else, we try to increase our income to pay for those \nextra comforts. \nForecasting net cash flows \nBudgets  can  be  prepared  weakly,  monthly  or  annually.    Expenses  can  be  forecast  months  in \nadvance  and  by  following  the  same  procedure a  sum  total  of  cash  outflows  can  be  determined.  \nSimilarly, if  there  are  any  other  sources  of income  like  interest  on  fixed  deposits,  or  rent  from \nproperty  they  can  also  be  summed  up  for  each  period  and  net  cash  flows  can  be  computed.    In \nthis manner, at least over the next few months, things can be quite accurately predicted. \nPositive net cash flows \nIf  positive  net  cash  flows  over  a  period  of  time  are  anticipated,  you  can  plan  for  purchasing \nproperty,  can or  actually  buying  in  instalments  and pay equated  monthly  instalments  (EMIs) \ntowards  owning  an  asset.

If  we  study  in  a \nschool,  college  or  in  an  institution,  we  need  to  learn  to  manage  money  we get from \nparents and guardians for paying fees, to buy books and stationary or to use as pocket \nmoney.  As grown-ups, when we work for a firm or running our own firm, we need to \nlearn to manage our incomes from our work or profits from our firms. In this chapter \nwe will try to answer questions Ashish has raised and suggest him what to do.   \nIn  our  day-to-day  life,  we manage  our  money  in  the  form  of  coins  and \ncurrencies  and  deposits  with  banks; we also  use cheques,  withdraw  cash  from \nautomated telling machines  (ATMs) using  debit  cards  and  purchase  goods  using \ncredit cards. In India, besides banks, we also put our money in post offices as well.  \nBanks are financial institutions which collect funds from the people and place \nthem  in  financial  assets  such  as  deposits,  loans  and  bonds  rather  than in tangible \nproperty. We  get a variety of services from banks ranging  from selling  gold to work \nas financial advisors. We get interest on savings we make and we are charged interest \non  loans we  get  from  banks. You  can  also  get  similar  banking  services  from  post \noffices as  well.  Even  though we  do  not  get a  variety  of  banking  services  that  we  get \nfrom banks, post offices play a very important role in promoting savings habit among \npeople  in  rural  and  urban  areas  and  at  the  same  time contribute  to  country’s \ndevelopment  by  meeting its financial  requirements. In  India, more  than  150 banks \nwith hundreds of their branches – both in public and in private sectors and nearly 1.5 \nlakh post offices play crucial role in managing our money.

There  is  usually  an  additional  balance  account  that \nparents must maintain for a child’s account. Such accounts instill financial discipline \nin a child by familiarizing him to the banking world. \nChildren  like  Julie  then  are  introduced  to  the  fundamentals  of  banking  transactions \nand  facilities,  such  as  debit  cards,  cheque  books,  fund  transfers,  withdrawal  and \ndeposits  of  money.  Her parents  are  enabling  her  to  decide  on  expenses  and  savings \nwith an account. The account is opened in the name of Julie but her parents hold the \ntransaction rights. The parents cannot use the account for depositing cheques received \nin  their  name.  Julie  is now  introduced  to  the  excitement  and  decision  making  skills \nimparted through the study of financial literacy. \nHowever,  in  the  absence  of  such  course,  a  child  needs  the  support  of  her  parents  to \nunderstand  the  implications of  spending  and  saving.  A  stark  reminder  of  financial \nindiscipline  is  the  increasing  chances  of  account  being inactive when  not  used  for  a \nyear. A child will not learn unless parents spend time with her.  \n  At  the  same  time  child’s  account  is  aimed  at  infusing  financial  rigour.  In  case  of \nmisuse,  the  parents  need  to  be  strict  with  the  expense.  For  example,  one  can  deposit  \n`. 5000 at the beginning of any month as a pocket money for let’s say five months.

There is no restriction on the number and the \namount  of  withdrawals  from  a  current  account.  There  are  no  interest  payments for \nmoney kept in current account.

In \nrecent times, banks offer a deposit option combining the positive sides of both deposit \nfacilities.

For example, roadside vendors selling \nflowers, vegetables, fruits and all such things cannot save a large amount. Banks and \npost offices also have a provision for opening account facilities for such people. They \ncan save  a  fixed  amount  every  day,  week  or  month  for  a  fixed  period.  This  is  called \nrecurring deposit.  The interest we get in this account is relatively higher than what we \nget from savings account facilities.  \nOne important recurring deposit facility available in post offices is 5-Year Post Office \nRecurring  Deposit  Account.  Any  individual  or  two  adults  jointly  can  open  this \naccount.  We  can  deposit  minimum  of `. 10  per  month (and  the  multiples  of  5  and \nthereafter). In case we are not able to pay for a month, we can pay within two months. \nIn these five years the account holder is excused four times for defaults of payment of \ninstalment. We can also partly withdraw our savings (about 50% of the balance after \none  year).  About  7.5%  is  paid  as  interest  every  three  months.  In  case  we  get  some \nadditional income and wish to deposit in this account, we can also get a rebate. \n \n Using Cheque Book Facilities  \nWhen we deposit money in our account in a bank, we can withdraw money from our \naccount in  many  ways.  We  need  to  visit  the  bank  and  fill  in  the  withdrawal  form  in \nwhich  we  can  fill  the  details  of  our  account and  put  our  signature and  submit  along \nwith the passbook to the bank.

The  other  way  is  to  use  cheques  issued by  the  bank and \nwithdraw money from your account or make payments.  \n \nMinimum Balance \nIn  order  to  use  cheques,  we  need  to  maintain  a  minimum  balance  in  our \naccount.

When our cheques bounce, we also lose credibility, \neven if we make payment without looking at our account balance unintentionally.  \nUpdating Your Pass Book \nAccount   holders   look   at   their   bank   passbook   to   know   their   financial \ntransactions  and  to  know  the  balance  amount.  Since  most  banks  in  India  have  been \ncomputerized,  when  we  ask  bankers  to  record  our  transaction,  they  use  printers  and \nprovide  update  of  our  transactions.  Some  banks  send  monthly  statement  containing \nour  transactions.  Whenever  we  engage  in  a  financial  transaction,  particularly  while \nmaking   payments   through   cheques,   we   need   to   check   with   our   cheque   book \ntransactions and mark off cleared cheques.  \n \nLet’s do some calculation for knowing account balance.  \nLast month Kavita had a cheque book savings account with a balance of `. 5000. This \nmonth, she received her salary of `. 7000 to her account. She made payments through \ncheques  totalling `. 7500  and  all  the  cheques  got  cleared.  She  did  not  withdraw  any \nfunds from her account. Calculate her balance for this month.  \n ","metadata":{"source":"C:\\Users\\Vedant\\Documents\\Projects\\JPMC-CFG\\Team-2\\server\\assets\\dataset\\personal_finance.pdf","pdf":{"version":"1.10.100","info":{"PDFFormatVersion":"1.6","IsAcroFormPresent":false,"IsXFAPresent":false,"Producer":"iLovePDF","ModDate":"D:20240615143354Z"},"metadata":null,"totalPages":114},"loc":{"pageNumber":26}}}],["4441b999-8759-41af-8836-5b5f54c09907",{"pageContent":" \n27 \nSolution:  \nLast month’s balance     `. 5000 \n+ Deposits   + `. 7000 \n-  Cheques that cleared -  `. 7500 \nNew balance   = `. 4500 \n \nWe need to be careful while looking at the monthly statement to determine our bank \nbalance.  Suppose  in  a  month  you  had  no  financial  transaction  in  your  account,  the \nbalance  from  your  monthly  statement  should  be  the  same  as  the  balance  on  your \npassbook as long as all the cheques you issued got cleared.

The  time between issuing a  cheque  until the  money  deducted  from our \naccount balance is referred to as the cheque float. This float is due to the time it takes \nfor the bank where the cheque was deposited to contact your bank. Sometimes postal / \ncourier delays also lead to delay in making payments. Earlier it used to take 3-15 days \nfor clearing outstation  cheques.  Suppose  you  send  a  cheque  from  Kolkata  to  buy  a \nbook in Chennai from a book publisher, cheques and requisition form reach Chennai \nwhich would take 2-3 days and the cheque has to be deposited to the service branch of \nyour bank in Chennai. All the transactions used to take 10-15 days. Now-a-days, due \nto the  Internet  and  improvement  in  electronic  communication,  the  float  period  has \nbeen  reduced  considerably to a  few  days particularly  in  cities.

The  time  period  and  the  interest  vary  with  company.  The \nmost popular credit cards available in India are Master Card, Maestro and Visa. \n \nHow does a Credit Card Work? \n In  India,  credit  cards  are  mostly  issued  by  banks and  credit  card  companies. These \ncards  are  accepted  by  most  business  outlets. Banks  honour  transactions  made  on  the \ncredit cards. Credit card companies receive a percentage (commonly between 2-4 per \ncent) of the payments made to business outlets with their credit cards. For example, if \nyou buy a colour television in a shop using Master Card and paid `. 10,000 in a retail \nshop, that retail shop will pay Master Card a percentage, about  `. 200.  Even though \nmost retail shops accept credit cards, some shops require this 2 per cent to be paid by \ncustomers as they do not wish to incur this cost.  \nBanks collaborating with credit card companies, issue credit cards, send bills to credit \ncard holders and  finance when necessary. They provide financing facilities for credit \ncard  holders  who  choose  to  pay  their  balance  in  full  when  they  receive  a  monthly \nstatement.  Banks  benefit  by  providing  financing  facilities  so  that  they  could  earn  a \nhigh rate of interest on the credit extended. This is also one of the reasons why people \ndo  not  use  credit  cards  for  purchases  involving  a  large  amount  of  money  such  as \nbuying a house, car and so on.  \nMonthly Statement \n        We  will receive  a  monthly  statement  in  which  the  details  of  previous  balance, \npurchases they made with the credit card during that period, cash advances, payments \nmade,  finance  charge,  new  balance  and  the  minimum  amount  we  need  to  pay  before \nthe  due  date.  The  statement  also  shows  the  method  of  calculating  interest  rate  or \nfinance charge and the detail of various services and charges. \n ","metadata":{"source":"C:\\Users\\Vedant\\Documents\\Projects\\JPMC-CFG\\Team-2\\server\\assets\\dataset\\personal_finance.pdf","pdf":{"version":"1.10.100","info":{"PDFFormatVersion":"1.6","IsAcroFormPresent":false,"IsXFAPresent":false,"Producer":"iLovePDF","ModDate":"D:20240615143354Z"},"metadata":null,"totalPages":114},"loc":{"pageNumber":29}}}],["942e7bb4-7ea7-4193-a444-5cafe3944643",{"pageContent":" \n30 \n \n \nHow to Apply for a Credit Card  \nWhen  we  apply  for  a  credit  card,  banks  require  information  to  assess  our \nability to repay credit such as our monthly income, monthly expenditure, past history \nof borrowing and savings and the details of our assets. They expect positive details of \nall information. However, banks issue credit cards even if some requirements are not \nsatisfactory. For example, for people working in the unorganised sector – working in \nprivate  companies,  banks  extend  a  limited  credit  limit  and  issue  credit  cards.  Some \nbanks require the details of income and existing debt level to assess the existing debt \nlevel as a percentage of income. If your debt is only a small fraction of your income, \nbanks  provide  credit  cards.

Some \ncards  known  as  gold  cards  or  platinum  cards  provide  extra  benefit  to  card  holders \ncovering insurance. You will receive upgrade to a gold or platinum card if you prove \nthat you are creditworthy by making more and more purchases and make  your credit \ncard payments on time. \nCredit Limit  \nBanks  issuing credit  cards  set  a  credit  limit  which  specifies  the  maximum \namount of credit allowed. This limit varies with individuals and is determined by the \nbanks on the basis of creditworthiness of persons applying for credit card. Credit card \nproviders also allow us to make purchase beyond our stated credit limit. This help in \npreventing situations in which we try to use credit card, but rejected as our maximum \ncredit limit has reached. A separate fee is charged for such purchases.  A similar fine \nis levied if we buy above the credit limit and without availing overdraft protection.  \nFree Credit Period \nWhenever  we  make  our  payments  through  credit  card,  credit  card  companies \nallow a free credit period in which we are not charged any interest on our purchases. \nThe  free  credit  period  is  usually  about  20-50  days  from  the  time  the  credit  card \nstatement is “closed” (any purchases after this date are put on the next month’s bill) \nand  the  time  the bill  is  due.

Although it is a convenient way of making payments for those who cannot \nmake payments at one time, it is expensive and should be avoided if possible.  \nUsing credit cards – some precautions \n(i) When we receive the monthly statement, we need to verify it carefully.

Sometimes  a  wrong  entry  might  have  been  included. \nFor  example,  when  you  were  issued the credit  card, you  were  promised  that \nthere would be no annual fee. However, after 2-3 years of use, you may find a \nmonthly  statement  having  included  the  annual  fee  in  your  account.  In  such \ncases, we need to immediately contact the bank or credit card company about \nthe  new  charges  debited  to  your  account. Credit  card  providers  also  specify \nduration say, 15 days (SBI card) and locations for jurisdiction for settling our \ndisputes as required by our consumer protection laws.  \n(ii) Due  to aggressive  marketing strategies,  we  tend  to  acquire  too  many credit \ncards from different credit card providers. This can complicate record keeping \nand  increase  the  probability  of  losing  one  or  more  credit  cards.  It  is  better  to \nuse  only  one  credit  card  to  cover  your  purchases.

MasterCard,  Maestro  and  Visa  are  accepted  by most  shops;  (ii) \nlook  for  credit  card  that  does  not  charge  an  annual  fee  and  (iii)  examine  the \ninterest rate / finance charges and other fees and choose a suitable credit card \nwhich has low  charges  and  fees.  Sometimes,  credit  card  providers  charge  a \nvery low  interest  but  charge  a  high  annual  fee  and  other  charges  (for  cash \nadvances,  late  payment,  service  taxes,  changes  in  the  finance  charges  when \nlate payments are made,  fee for accessing credit  beyond the maximum limit). \nCustomers need to be cautioned of these hidden costs which the companies do \nnot reveal to them.   \n \n ","metadata":{"source":"C:\\Users\\Vedant\\Documents\\Projects\\JPMC-CFG\\Team-2\\server\\assets\\dataset\\personal_finance.pdf","pdf":{"version":"1.10.100","info":{"PDFFormatVersion":"1.6","IsAcroFormPresent":false,"IsXFAPresent":false,"Producer":"iLovePDF","ModDate":"D:20240615143354Z"},"metadata":null,"totalPages":114},"loc":{"pageNumber":33}}}],["c45754c3-0035-4a42-a34b-3570b8afbc65",{"pageContent":" \n34 \nActivity  \nYou plan to apply for a credit card A because it has no annual fee, while credit card B \nhas  an  annual  fee  of `. 3000.

You can go to \na  bank  in  Chandigarh,  hand over `. 10,000  with  a  small  commission  and  ask  for  a \nbank  draft  on  another  bank  in  Bangalore.  The  Chandigarh  bank  writes  a  draft  in \nfavour  of  your  friend  in  Bangalore  directing  the  bank  in  Chandigarh  to  pay  him  the \namount  on  demand. You  can  take  the draft  issued by the  bank  and  post it  to  your \nfriend  in  Bangalore.  On  receipt  of  it,  your  friend  can  submit  the  draft  in  the  bank  in \nwhich  he  has an account.  He  gets `. 10,000  deposited  in  his  account.  Similarly, \nmoney can also be transferred from one country to another.  \nCore banking transfer \nIt is another  advance facility  offered  by  banks.  Suppose  you  wish  to  send  /  transfer \nmoney  to  your  uncle  having an account  in  another  branch  either  within  the  town  or \ncity  or  elsewhere,  you  can  pay  the amount  in  the  nearby  bank  /  issue  a  cheque and \nrequest  the  bank  to  transfer  the  money  to  your  uncle.  Within  a  few  minutes,  your \nmoney  gets  transferred  electronically.  Some  banks  charge  a  small  amount  for  this \nservice  and  others  charge  only  for  large  amounts. For  example,  State  Bank  of  India \nallows us to transfer about `. 50,000 without any service charges on a day.  \nOther Services \nPeople  also  use  draft  facilities  to  pay  for  various  services  provided  by \norganisations   or   for   paying   institutional   fees.   Suppose   you   wish   to   apply   for \ngovernment   job   or   for   taking   admission   to   a   course   offered   by   colleges   and \nuniversities run by governments, people pay the required amount to the bank and get \ndrafts and apply. When you apply for a draft for paying outside the city or town  you \nare  residing,  it  is  called  draft.  For  making  payments  within  the  city,  banks  issue \nbanker’s cheques. Similar services are also offered by post offices also. It is known as \npostal orders.

You are aware that  you can send  your \nmoney through money order. One advantage of  money order is that  you  do not need \nto post anything as in the case of drafts. Post offices take the responsibility of paying \nthe  money  to  the  payee  and  also  the message  you  wish  to  pass  on.  These  days,  post \noffices  allow  us  to  know  the  status  of  money  orders  that  we  sent  through  telephone \nand the  Internet  facilities.  However,  the  service  charge  for  money  order  is  relatively \nhigher  than the  bank  drafts.  At  present,  post  offices  charge `. 5  for  every `. 100 as \nmoney order charges (see Box for the details of service charges for bank drafts). One \nsuggestion  is  that  for  making  large  payments  beyond `. 1000,  we should  use draft \nfacilities and for lesser amounts we can use money order facilities.   \n \nInternet and Mobile Banking \nGoing  to  post  offices  and  banks  and  requesting  their  banking  services  to  send  or \ntransfer money generally require sufficient time. Technological advancements provide \na lot of options today. One latest option is the Internet banking. Suppose  you have  a \nsavings  /  current  account,  you  can  approach  your  bank.  After  completing  the \nformalities  required by the bank,  you  will  be  issued  two  secret  codes – a username \nand a password.  Using  these  details,  you  can  transfer  your  money  or  receive  money \nfrom  others  electronically using  computer  and the  Internet.  You  can  also  use  this \nfacility to pay your bills. For example, if you wish to pay for electricity, you can pay \nthrough the Internet banking facilities. The Internet banking allows you to check your \naccount  balance,  view  your  account,  request  for  a  cheque  book,  drafts, banker’s \ncheques, and give instructions to stop cheque payment. We can also give instructions \nsuch as request for third party transfers, invest and renew term deposits.  \nHowever, you need to take certain precautions while using these facilities. For \nexample, you should not divulge the details of username and password to others (see \nbox). Banks provide all such precautions when we approach them to avail this facility. \nVery  recently,  banks  also  enable  us  to  use  cell  phones  for  money  transfer  and  other \nservices.  \n \n \n ","metadata":{"source":"C:\\Users\\Vedant\\Documents\\Projects\\JPMC-CFG\\Team-2\\server\\assets\\dataset\\personal_finance.pdf","pdf":{"version":"1.10.100","info":{"PDFFormatVersion":"1.6","IsAcroFormPresent":false,"IsXFAPresent":false,"Producer":"iLovePDF","ModDate":"D:20240615143354Z"},"metadata":null,"totalPages":114},"loc":{"pageNumber":36}}}],["3d4d13fd-929d-478a-947e-107d1ed6742b",{"pageContent":" \n37 \nUsing the Internet Banking: Some Precautions \n1.

They  are  different \nfrom  items  of  daily  use  such  as  food  items, \ncosmetics,  clothes,  etc., because  they  usually \nlast  for  a  much  longer  period  of  time,  and  the \nowner does not have to replace them frequently. \nThe same is not the case with items like a toothbrush, or a t-shirt – they wear out soon.  \nHowever,  personal  assets  also  tend  to  be  much  more  expensive  than items  of  daily  use – good \nexamples of such are a house, a piece of land, a car, an expensive computer, etc. The purchaser \nof  personal  assets  may  need  to  seek  financial  help  to  arrange  money  to  complete  the  purchase. \nWe  will  discuss  the  types  of  financial  help  available  to  people  to  complete  the  purchase  of \nvarious types of personal assets.  \n \nLoan \nIf  you  plan  to  buy  an  asset,  you  may  seek  a  loan  from  a bank  or  a financial institution  (called \n‘lenders’) against the security of the asset. The loan is provided at the time of purchase and it can \nbe  repaid  over  a  period  of  time  through  instalments.  The  security  of  the  assets  means  that  the \nlender can seize the asset in case you fail to pay the loan back, either partly or completely – this \nis called ‘default’. In case of you ‘defaulting’, the lender can retrieve the lent money by selling \nthe asset. \nApplying for a loan \nWhile  applying  for  a  loan,  you  need  to  provide  information  about  your personal  financial \nposition  to  the  lender  to  show  your  ability  to  repay  the  loan.  Your  personal  financial  position \nmeans a record of the assets you already own, the debts you owe to other people or lenders, and \nyour monthly/ annual income and expenses.

Mostly, the asset to be purchased serves \nas  security  to  the  lender.  If  you  buy  a  house  on  loan,  and  do  not  repay  the  loan,  the  lender  can \nseize the house and sell it to recover the money lent to you. \nRepayment of loan \nEMIs or  Equated  Monthly  Instalments  are  used,  in  most  cases,  to  repay  loans  taken  to  finance \npersonal  assets.  EMIs  are  calculated  in  such  a  manner  that  the  same  amount  is payable  by  the \nborrower to the lender every month over the tenure of the loan, and by the time the last EMI is \nmade, the  entire loan amount is repaid. The critical thing  about understanding EMIs is that this \namount captures both the repayment of the loan principal, as well as the loan interest.  \nManaging  your  personal  finances  well  is  the  key  to  leading  a  secure  life.  You  must  always \ncorrectly  estimate  the  amount  of  assets  you  can  purchase,  and  also  keep  a  check  on your \nexpenses.  Losing  track  of  these  and over-estimating  your  purchasing  capacity,  say  by  taking  a \nloan,  for  which  EMI  payments  are  more  than  what  you  can  bear,  could  lead  you  into  financial \ntroubles. \n \nEducation Loan \nAcquisition of any type of asset requires money. If you do not have the entire quantum of funds \nrequired  to  obtain  the  desired  asset,  you  turn  to  financial  institutions,  mostly  banks,  which \nprovide  funding  in the form  of  loans.  Human  resources  are  a  part  of  the  social  capital  of  a \ncountry.  \nWhy Education loan? \n Education  creates  academic  and  professional  skills  and  knowledge  in  human  beings,  thereby \ncreating  human  capital.  People  use  such  skills  to  gain  employment  and  generate  income  for \nthemselves. Thus, it is important that no deserving student is denied education for want of funds. \nFinancial institutions provide loans to support education, and development of skills to sustain the \nsocial capital of the nation. The objective of these loans is to bring education within the reach of \nstudents and help them improve their future prospects.  \nAmount \n The  loan  amount  ranges  from `. 1  lakh  to  10  lakh.  The  foremost  criteria  for  obtaining  an \neducation loan is that one must have secured admission to a general / technical course in India or \nabroad.

You can try to negotiate the price by \noffering  a  lower  price, i.e., `. 45,00,000,  keeping  the  average  price  assessed  by  you  as  your \nreference.

A  mortgage  is  a  legal  agreement  which  assigns  the  ownership  of  the  house  to  the \nbank or lender till the loan is fully repaid. Since this legal agreement (or mortgage) is an inherent \npart of the loan sanctioning procedure by banks or lenders, such loans are called mortgage loans.  \nIn a mortgage loan, usually the bank expects  you to cover a portion of the total price with  your \nown money, which is known as ‘down payment’, and is usually 10-20 percent of the total price. \nLenders  (banks  or  financial  institutions)  give  mortgage  loans  at  different  rates  of  interest.  You \nshould  obtain  a  mortgage  loan that  has  a  low  interest  rate,  as  this  will  help  keep  the  monthly \ninstalments  lower  than  those  paid  at  high  interest  rate  mortgage  loan.  The  maturity  period  of \nmortgage  indicates  the  duration  by  the  end  of  which  you  will  be  required  to  pay  off  the  loan. \nShorter  maturity  period  mortgages  loans  have  higher  monthly  instalments,  but  also  help  in \nreducing the interest paid on the loan and, in turn, the total amount of repayment. The benefit of \nlonger  duration  loans  is  that  you  have  smaller  monthly  instalments  and  you  have  more  cash \navailable on hand with you. \nIf  the  cost  of  house  of  your  choice  is `. 52,25,000.  You  make  a  down  payment  of  the  total \namount of loan, i.e., `. 5,22,500 (10% of the price) out of your own savings. You need a loan of \n`. 47,02,500 from the bank at the rate of interest  of 9.50% per annum. Now  you have to take a \ndecision  whether  you  will  take  the  loan  for  a  period  of  10  years  or  20  years.  You  can  make  a \ncomparison between the repayment schedule of the short and long duration loans. \n \n \n \n \n ","metadata":{"source":"C:\\Users\\Vedant\\Documents\\Projects\\JPMC-CFG\\Team-2\\server\\assets\\dataset\\personal_finance.pdf","pdf":{"version":"1.10.100","info":{"PDFFormatVersion":"1.6","IsAcroFormPresent":false,"IsXFAPresent":false,"Producer":"iLovePDF","ModDate":"D:20240615143354Z"},"metadata":null,"totalPages":114},"loc":{"pageNumber":49}}}],["4af88d30-dba7-4d86-8d22-5118beee868b",{"pageContent":" 50 \n                                                20-Year Repayment Schedule \nTimeline EMI No. EMI Interest Principal \nOutstanding \nPrincipal \n1 Month 1 43,833  37,228  6,605  46,95,895  \n2 Years 24 43,833  35,915  7,919  45,28,665  \n4 Years 48 43,833  34,265  9,569  43,18,613  \n6 Years 72 43,833  32,271  11,562  40,64,797  \n8 Years 96 43,833  29,862  13,971  37,58,100  \n10 Years 120 43,833  26,951  16,882  33,87,504  \n12 Years 144 43,833  23,434  20,399  29,39,696  \n14 Years 168 43,833  19,184  24,649  23,98,589  \n16 Years 192 43,833  14,048  29,785  17,44,745  \n18 Years 216 43,833  7,843  35,991  9,54,676  \n20 Years 240 43,833  344  43,489  0  \n   \n58,17,533 47,02,500 \n \n \n                                                    10-Year Repayment Schedule \nTimeline EMI No. EMI Interest Principal \nOutstanding \nPrincipal \n1 Month 1 60,849  37,228  23,621  46,78,879  \n2 Month 2 60,849  37,041  23,808  46,55,071  \n1 Year 12 60,849  35,088  25,761  44,06,374  \n2 Years 24 60,849  32,531  28,318  40,80,857  \n3 Years 36 60,849  29,720  31,129  37,23,034  \n4 Years 48 60,849  26,631  34,218  33,29,698  \n5 Years 60 60,849  23,235  37,614  28,97,324  \n6 Years 72 60,849  19,502  41,347  24,22,038  \n7 Years 84 60,849  15,398  45,451  18,99,582  \n8 Years 96 60,849  10,887  49,962  13,25,272  \n9 Years 108 60,849  5,929  54,921  6,93,964  ","metadata":{"source":"C:\\Users\\Vedant\\Documents\\Projects\\JPMC-CFG\\Team-2\\server\\assets\\dataset\\personal_finance.pdf","pdf":{"version":"1.10.100","info":{"PDFFormatVersion":"1.6","IsAcroFormPresent":false,"IsXFAPresent":false,"Producer":"iLovePDF","ModDate":"D:20240615143354Z"},"metadata":null,"totalPages":114},"loc":{"pageNumber":50}}}],["0527879e-339d-430a-bf38-26d140818865",{"pageContent":" 51 \n10 Years 120 60,849.20  477.94 60,371.26  0.00 \n   \n25,99,404 47,02,500 \n \n \nThus,  you  look  at  the total  repayment schedule,  principal  as  well  as  interest,  for  both  10  years \nand 20 years mortgage loans which are as follows: \n \n \n20-Year Mortgage Loan 10-Year Mortgage Loan \nTotal Principal Payments \n47,02,500 47,02,500 \nTotal Interest Payments \n58,17,533 25,99,404 \nTotal Payments  1,05,20,033 73,01,904 \n \nAs  evident  from  the  above  table,  you  will  pay `. 32,18,129  more  in interest  with  20-year \nmortgage loan than with 10-year mortgage loan.

Do you know \nwhat this premium is and how it is determined? How does insurance actually help?  \n \nLet  us  assume  that  there  is  a  colony  which  has  1000  houses  valued  at `. 15,00,000 \neach.  All  these  owners  need  to  protect  their  property  against  uncertainties  like  fire, \ntheft or any other damage to the house. They pay a  certain amount say `. 10,000 as \npremium  to  an  insurance  company  to  protect  themselves  against  any  loss.  The \ninsurance  company, thus,  pools  the  amount  paid  as  premium  by  the  owners  and \nassures them that it would  compensate the house owners in case of any loss by fire, \ntheft etc. The owners benefit by such an arrangement as by paying a sum of `. 10,000 \nannually, they are now assured of protection against risks or uncertainties since they \nwill be compensated by the insurance company. The insurance company will pay the \namount from the premiums which it had charged from the owners.  \nIn  case  there  is  fire,  the  owners  who  have  got their property  insured  and  paid  the \npremium on time will be compensated by the insurance company. In this manner, the \neconomic burden is shared by all the house owners in the colony. Since all the house \nowners  are  contributing  premiums,  the  insurance  company  is  able  to pool  this \npremium  into  a  fund or  corpus  and  accordingly  when  required  compensate  the \nowners  against  the  loss.  The  probability  that all  the  houses  will  be  on  fire  is  very \nremote, hence the insurance company also benefits by this agreement and the owners \ntoo are assured  in  exchange  for  a premium.  This  means if the  risk is higher  the \ninsurance company will charge a higher premium. \nThere is also a chance that some owners may refuse to contribute to compensate the \nvictim.  The insurance  company  then  needs  to collect  funds  in  advance  to  meet  the \nloss.  This will  require  some  calculations  on  the  basis  of  past  experience  to  estimate \nthe amount of loss. Here, it is presumed that 2 out of 1000 houses may burn or bear \nloss  annually. This  also  means  that  contributions  made  by  the  landowners  annually \nmay  increase  to `. 15,000.  The  increased  sum  will  meet  the  cost  of  loss  as  well  as \nother expenses incurred in the operation of the programme.

In  insurance,  we  can  say,  the  risk  is  transferred  or  shifted  from  one \nperson  to  a  group  (i.e., all  the  owners)  and  a  person’s  loss  is  shared  by  all  the \nmembers of the group.  \nFrom  the  above  example  we  can  say that  insurance  is  a  protective  device to  one’s \nhealth and property. In this case the individual incurs a certain cost (the premium) for \na  large  uncertain  financial  loss (the  contingency  insured  against)  that  would  exist  if \nthere were no insurance.  \n \nCan you manage risk in life? \nWhen   any   individual   buys   insurance,   he/she   transfers   a   portion   of   risk   for \ncompensation  to  the  insurance  company.  The  company  in  turn provides  him/ her \nprotection at a price, but it’s a fraction of recurring expense borne by you annually. It \nis  true  that  events  cannot  be  predicted  but  the  probability  of  events occurring  can  be \ncalculated  on  the  basis  of  past  experience.  Henceforth,  steps  need  to  be taken  to \nreduce the chance or extent of loss to one’s health and property. For example, the use \nof seat belt in the car can reduce the chance of auto injuries and deaths. Therefore, we \nbuy  an  insurance  policy  and  we  transfer  the  risk  to  the  insurance  company  in \nexchange for a fee called premium. \n \nNature of Insurance \n       Insurance  is  a  cooperative  device  under  which  a  group  of  persons  who  agree to \nshare  the  financial  loss  to  either  of them  may be  brought  together  voluntarily  by  a \nregistered  company. These  companies  are  called  insurers  and  are  the  risk  bearers. \nThey provide insurance to the customer / client who are called the insured.  The risk is \nevaluated  by  the  insurer and  an amount is  charged  from  the insured.  This  amount  is \ncalled  the premium. The  insurance  companies  provide  insurance  policies.

These  are  considered  safe  investments as \nreturns are guaranteed by the bank. Other safe investments are provident fund, public provident \nfund, saving schemes in post offices, etc. \nThere  are  many  other  avenues  for  investment  which  may  give  higher  returns  than  banks.  Of \ncourse,  the risks  will also  increase as  higher  returns  are  expected.  For  this,  you  may  invest  in \nshares and debentures of a company, mutual funds, bonds and other investment plans. These are \ngenerally  known  as  financial  products.   Mutual  funds  are of  various  types  and  investment  in \nthem  can  be  tailored  to  suit  your  requirements.  We  shall  learn  about  this  and  other  financial \nproducts in this section. \n \nWhy Invest? \nWhen  we  have  surplus  money,  we  think  about  investing  it  in  something  which  gives  us  good \nreturn. We may start on our business if we are enterprising, and willing to undertake risk. In this \ncase, we are using our surplus money or funding a business and expect to earn a good return. \nIn  case  we  are  not  willing  to  start  our business, we  may  invest  our  money  in  other  companies \nthrough  shares  or  debentures.  If  we  do  not  have  enough  information  about  the  stock  exchange \noperations then we may consult a financial advisor for investment in other financial products like \ngovernment bonds, mutual funds, etc.   \nSaving  money  in  an  almirah  is  not  an  investment.  However,  saving  money in  a  bank  is  an \ninvestment as it assures some return on your investment. Investor buys the shares of a particular \ncompany in expectation of earning a better return in terms of appreciation in the market price of \nthe share. Similarly, when an investor subscribes to the debentures of a company, he  expects a \nfixed interest return for a given period. When a person invests in a house he either plans for his \nown  stay or  to  earn  some  rental  income.  Investment  in  insurance  assures  security as  well  as \nminimum return to the insurers.

Today managing  one’s  investment  has \nbecome  challenging  and  complex.  Due  to  new  economic and  political  situations,  stock  markets \nacross  the  globe  witness  unprecedented  volatility.  Domestic  markets,  too,  have  been  integrated \nwith  the  global  markets  ever  since  the  boom  in technology. Therefore,  investment  in  different \ntypes of products in one’s portfolio at this juncture would be beneficial to any individual in many \nways. \n Investors in  general spend  a  lot  of  time  deciding  about  a  financial  product. In  India,  investors \nprefer  to  invest  in  secured  debt  products  that  guarantees  return  from  it. Therefore,  banks  fixed \ndeposits or saving deposits form one of the biggest components of investment. Be it a share or a \nmutual  fund,  they  are  looking  for  returns  and  checking  whether  it  is  beating  the  benchmark \nindices. This kind of haphazard investment is not recommended. A financial advisor would want \ninvestors to set their goals and accordingly decide the different products/assets to include in their \nportfolio. \n \nHow can Varmas benefit by diversifying their investment portfolio \nRohit  Varma  decides  to  invest  in  real  estate.

Investment  in  different  assets  is  based  on  the \nnotion that even when there is a fluctuation in some assets (in terms of up and down movement \nin an economy) one is assured of consistent average return from one’s portfolio.

For example, you expect \nto  earn  15%  rate  of  return  on  your  investment  but  in  actual  you  earn  only  12%  thus  you  fail  to \nminimize your risk. Safety is an important factor to consider while allocating funds to assets. \n Liquidity  \n Liquidity is conversion  of  your  assets into cash.  Investment  of  funds  in  some securities may \nprovide  high  return  after a fixed  period  of time.  In  the  meantime if you  need cash,  buyers may \nnot be available as they may be infrequently traded shares. Here you may have to compromise by \nselling at a lower price. We see, that this share was not easily converted into cash and hence not \nso  liquid.

When it comes to \ninvesting in  shares,  an  investor  like  Rajiv  has an  option  of  choosing  from over  5000 different \ntypes of securities.  \n  \nInvestment in shares \nInvestment in the equity of a company involves buying shares of private and public companies. It \nis one of the most rewarding and at the same time volatile instruments for investing. When you \ninvest in shares of a company, you become part owner of the company and, hence, share both the \nprofit and losses that the companies make. They can be brought from either the primary market-- \ndirectly  from  the  company  during  a  public  offering--or  the  secondary  market,  i.e., the  stock \nexchange. Stock  market deals  with trading  of  shares and  their  prices  fluctuate  on  a  daily  basis. \nLet  us  assume  Rajiv  has  brought  10  shares  of  company  X  for `. 1000.  After  five  days  share \nprices  increase  to `. 1500,  that means  Rajiv  can  make  a  profit  of `. 500.  However,  if  the  price \nfalls to `. 500, then he makes a loss of `. 500.    \nA return on investment in shares is obtained through dividends and share price appreciation. The \nmarket price of the share depends on the number of buyers and sellers of the share. In addition, \nthe  demand  and  supply  of  the  share for  sale  is also  influenced  by  the firm’s  business \nperformance, as measured by its earnings and other characteristics. When the firm performs well, \nits  stocks  become  more  desirable  for  the  investors.

Some  firms  distribute  quarterly  income  to  their  shareholders \nin the form of dividends rather than reinvest the earnings in the firm’s operations. \nSome individual investors called day traders buy stock and then sell them on the same day. They \nhope  to  earn  a  return  on  a  very  short  term  movement  in  share  prices.  Day  trading  is  not \nrecommended  for  most  investors.  Moreover,  this  type  of  investment  is  risky  because  the  stock \nprices of even best managed firms periodically decline. \nWhere do you think Rajiv should invest? \nThere are certain sunrise industries like biotechnology, and sunset industries like jute. There are \nhigh-tech  industries  (instrumentation),  and low  tech  industries (solvent  extraction).  Then there \nare  capital-intensive  industries  like petrochemicals,  and  labour-intensive  like  textiles.  Thus, \nindustries  can  be  classified  into  several  types.  Each  industry  goes  through  a  certain life  cycle \nfrom a small beginning to massive growth, to stagnation and eventual decline. Thus, Rajiv has to \ntake a decision on the basis of the information he collects about various companies. \n \nBonds \nBonds  are  issued  to  raise  funds  in  the  same  way  an  individual  borrows funds  from banks.  An \nindividual has to hypothecate its assets with the bank as security in proportion to the demand for \nthe loan. In case of failure of an individual to refund the money, the bank has the right to sell off \nthese assets to recover its dues. On similar lines, a corporate can borrow funds from the general \npublic.  Here  the sole  borrower  is  a  company  and  there  are  many  moneylenders  in  the  form  of \nindividual investors. Since a company cannot pledge or mortgage its assets separately with each \nindividual, it pledges its assets with a trust constituted for this purpose. The trustee is conferred \nwith the power to dispose of the assets of the company in case of failure to meet the commitment \nof  individual  investors.

She attended the farewell party organised by \nher grandfather’s office colleagues on his retirement. She wondered how he would manage \nhis  expenses  without  his  usual  salary.  Her grandfather  then  explained  since  he  was \nworking in a government office, he would be getting a sum every month known as pension. \nHad he worked in a private organisation or engaged in business, he would not be getting \npension.  In  that  case  he  would  have  to plan  or  invest  money  to  get  a  regular  flow  of \nincome.  Sheila  suddenly  realised  that  her  grandfather  still  willingly  provided  her  with \npocket  money.  She  wondered  if  there  was  no  pension  what  would  her  grandfather  have \ndone?   \nRetirement  planning  is  a  part  of  overall  financial  planning  process.  It  is  an  attempt  to \nfigure out how much money  you need to save  each month in order to have a comfortable \nretirement  and be  financially secure by making best of the  accumulated retirement assets. \nPlanning  for  retirement acquires  added  importance  because,  normally,  people  over-\nestimate  what  they  have  and  under-estimate  how  much  they  would  need  for  their  post- \nretirement. At  the  verge  of  retirement,  your  needs  will rapidly  be  changing.  You  will  be \nasking the big questions – what does retirement mean to me, and will I have enough? How \ncan I be better off? As our lives change, our financial needs and priorities change too.  \nWhether  you  are  a  salaried  person  employed  with a government  organisation  or  a  private \nsector organisation or a self-employed person, the fact remains that you have to retire one \nday. The benefit with the person employed with any government organisation is that there \nis a provision for a pension scheme which serves as a regular income to the retired person \nto  support  his/her  monthly  expenses  in  the  post-retirement  years.

You  can  choose  the  age  but  cannot  postpone  it  indefinitely. \nThe biggest question is, when the time of retirement arrives, will you have enough income \nto continue the lifestyle you were enjoying before retirement. The amount of pension alone \nwill not be sufficient for most of us. Remember, the average life expectancy is improving \nwith the advancement in the health care sector. The average person who retires at the age \nof 58-60 looks forward to another 20  years of life. For this it becomes imperative to save \nenough funds in your 30-35 working life.  \nThus,  in  order  to  be  comfortable  in the post-retirement  years, there  is  a need  to  start \nplanning  from  today  itself. The  sooner you start  investing,  the  better  it  is. You can  then \nexperience  the effect  of  compounding. Let  us  take  an  example:  Yogesh,  who  is  now  25 \nyears  of  age in  2011,  starts  investing `. 10,000  every  month.  If  his  investments  grow  by \n6% p.a., he will end up with `. 1.38 crore in 2046 when he attains the age of 60. If he puts \noff this exercise for next 10 years, that is, till 2021, he will end up with `. 67.95 lakh.  \nDid  you notice that this amount is less than half the amount that he would have if he had \nbegan investing early? It  is  crucial  to  stay  on  track,  that  is,  remain  committed  and \ndisciplined.  If  you  give  up  the  habit  of  saving  and  investing  midway,  it  will  not  yield  the \nexpected returns and affect the financial plan for retirement.  \nIn order to know how much you need to save, you first need to ascertain how much funds \nyou  will  need  after  retirement.  This  involves  calculating  your  monthly  earnings  (from \noccupation,  interest,  dividends,  pension  or  any  other  investment  that  you  might  have). \nHere, it is necessary to take into account the rate of inflation.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nInflation is a widespread and sustained increase in the general price level of goods and \nservices.

There  is  a \nsimple method of calculating how long it will take for your money to double: divide 72 by \nthe interest rate. For example, at 8% it takes 9 years (72/9), it takes approx. 6 years (72/12) \nand at  24  %  it  takes  3  years  (72/24).  This  rule  applies  to  compound  interest  only.  The \nimpact  of  compound  interest  is  solely  reaped  in  the  long  run.  The  longer  you  keep  your \ninvestments on compound interest basis, the greater is your gain. The best way is to invest \nin  mutual  funds or  set  up  a  RD  account  with  a  bank. The  decision  regarding  choosing \nbetween an RD and SIP depend on one’s requirement, risk taking aptitude and the time \nperiod of investment. \nAlign your Assets \nCreating a regular income \nIt  is  always  better that you  align  your  assets  as  one  portfolio. Your  assets  or  your \ninvestments need to be arranged in such a manner that there is a regular flow of income at \ndifferent intervals. Though the reasons for your investment may be different, you must see \nyour portfolio  as  one. This  will  enable  you  to  review your investment  in different  assets.  \nIn  your  portfolio  you  must  reallocate  these  assets  from  time  to  time  to  optimise  their \nreturns. Whatever  the  amount  of  corpus  you  have,  you  must  have  a  mode  of  regular \nincome  in  the  form  of  dividends,  interests  or  systematic  withdrawals.  Hence,  you  must \ncreate  an income  ladder with  manageable  diversified  portfolio  to  suit  your  needs  and \nrequirements. \nOne  of  the  best  options  to  get  a  regular  income  is annuities. Annuities are  monthly \npayments  you  receive  from  a  financial  institution  after  you  invest  a  lump  sum  in  it.  The \nreturns  from  these  investments  along  with  a  part  of  principal  form  the  monthly  payment \naccruing to  you. You can buy an annuity plan from a life insurance company or  a mutual \nfund.  A  regular  income  can  also  be  generated  from  a  variety  of  investment  instruments \nsuch  as  National  Savings  Certificates  or  deep  discount  bonds  that  give  you  a  pre- \ndetermined  lump  sum  on  maturity.  If  you  invest  in  these at  regular  intervals your \ninvestments  will  mature  at  regular  intervals  in  your  retirement years  creating  a  regular \nincome flow.

We bear taxes when we spend money  and  also when we earn money. Not many of us \nwillingly part with their hard earned money for taxes. You must have often heard your elders’ \nsay, “what  do  we  get  that  we  should  pay  taxes?”  Payment  of  taxes  is  not  only  the  duty  of \nevery citizen but an essential requirement for existence of our country as a prosperous, secure, \nstable and a just nation-state. \nYou know that government spends money for providing many public services, like, highways, \npolice,  defence, etc., and  basic  facilities  such  as  schools  and  hospitals  to  the  poor  and \nunderprivileged thus creating an egalitarian society. It is also used for funding developmental \nprogrammes and services. Government gets money from taxes and therefore it is vital for all \nits citizens to pay taxes.

It  regulates  consumption  of  some \ncommodities  (tobacco  is  taxed,  for  example,  to  discourage  smoking,  and  other  injurious \ncommodities  like  alcohol, etc).  To  ensure  long-term  growth  it  may  impose  taxes  on \nproduction  of  consumer  goods  and  give  concession  for  production  of  capital  goods.  Apart \nfrom  interest  rates,  the  deductions  allowed  in  taxes  for  the  savings  also  inspire  people  to \nsave.  The  provision  of  exemptions  of  income  that  have  been  diverted  into  various  saving \nschemes  results  in  increased  saving  in  the  economy.  Taxes  also  help  in  redistribution. \nNormally,  this  means  transferring  wealth  from  the  richer  sections  of  society  to  poorer \nsections, thereby reducing inequality in the income levels. When government imposes taxes \non  the  richer  section  and  uses  it  for  the  welfare  of  it  citizens,  it  is  transferring  wealth  from \nfew   high   income   groups   to   low   income   groups.   Taxes   also   make   the   government \naccountable.  The  government  tax  citizens,  and  citizens  in  turn  demand  accountability  from \ntheir government.   \n \nTax planning implies minimization of taxes-- pay as little as possible by saving and investing \nwisely. The goal is to arrange financial affairs so as to minimize taxes. How can we do this? \nThe key lies in prudent and effective tax planning. It is important to plan for taxes as it affects \nyour  personal  budget-- your  savings,  expenditure  and  consumption  so  dearly.  Tax planning \nmeans  devising  strategies all  the  year  round  so  as  to  minimize  the  liability  of  tax  that  one \nowes to the government. You have to plan sensibly so as to pay less money to the government \nas tax thereby reducing your tax burden. As a result save more money for yourself. Planning \ntaxes reduces the burden of tax on a person and also helps him to make savings by investing \nin various saving schemes. \n \nIndia  has  a  well-developed  taxation  structure.  The  tax  system  in  India  is  mainly  a  three-tier \nsystem, comprising the  Central government,  State  Governments  and  the  local government’s \norganizations which include panchayats and municipalities.  \n ","metadata":{"source":"C:\\Users\\Vedant\\Documents\\Projects\\JPMC-CFG\\Team-2\\server\\assets\\dataset\\personal_finance.pdf","pdf":{"version":"1.10.100","info":{"PDFFormatVersion":"1.6","IsAcroFormPresent":false,"IsXFAPresent":false,"Producer":"iLovePDF","ModDate":"D:20240615143354Z"},"metadata":null,"totalPages":114},"loc":{"pageNumber":99}}}],["9b965885-47fa-4bd8-98dd-b8c524cef04b",{"pageContent":" 101 \nHistory of taxation: \nTaxation dates back to earliest recorded history. In the beginning, in all societies, the most \ncommon way to collect taxes was in kind. Taxes were paid in the form of gold-coins, cattle, \ngrains, raw materials and even by rendering personal service. As economies became money \nbased, countries started  collecting taxes in cash.  In addition to the revenues from land, tax \non  the  basis  of  ownership  of  immovable  properties  also  became  prevalent.  Evidence  show \nthat all historical leaders and head countrymen collected taxes to run its authority.  \nIn  India,  the  tradition  of  taxation  has  a  long  history.  Archeological  findings  indicate  a \ntaxation  system  as  old  as  about  6000  years  ago  at  a  place  called  Lagash.  It  finds  its \nreferences  in  many  ancient  books  like  'Manu  Smriti'  and  'Arthasastra'.  Manu,  the  sage  and \nlawgiver  in  Vedic  times,  stated  in  his  ‘Manu  Smriti’  that  the  king  could  levy  tax  and \nadvised that taxes should be related to the profession, income and expenditure of the person. \nWith the coming on of the Mughals in  India, the country  witnessed  a sea of  change in the \ntaxation system of India. Although, they also practised the same norm of taxation but it was \nmore homogeneous in structure and collection.   \nThe period of British rule in India witnessed some remarkable change in the taxation system \nof India. The objectives of taxation were designed to protect and enlarge the economic and \nstrategic interests  of  the  East  India  Company  and  the  Crown.  After  the  revolt  of  1857,  the \nfirst formal income-tax on traders and professionals became operative in 1860. Setting up of \nadministrative system and taxation system was first done in the history of taxation system in \nIndia  in  1922.  Independent  India  brought  out  changes  in  the  nature  and  objectives  of \ntaxation,  which  became  directly  linked  with  national  programmes  for  citizens’  welfare. \nNowadays taxation is seen as an instrument not only to augment finance of the government \nbut also to fulfill certain social objective, both being interlinked.  \n \nTaxes are collected from a number of sources. The government raises revenue from a variety \nof  taxes -- taxes  on  income  (like,  individual  income  tax,  corporate  income tax)  taxes  on \nproperty  (like,  wealth  tax,  estate  taxes,  death  duties,  property  taxes),  taxes  on  commodities \n(like,   sales   tax,   excise   duties,   customs   duties)   and   other   taxes   (like   service   taxes, \nentertainment taxes).  \n ","metadata":{"source":"C:\\Users\\Vedant\\Documents\\Projects\\JPMC-CFG\\Team-2\\server\\assets\\dataset\\personal_finance.pdf","pdf":{"version":"1.10.100","info":{"PDFFormatVersion":"1.6","IsAcroFormPresent":false,"IsXFAPresent":false,"Producer":"iLovePDF","ModDate":"D:20240615143354Z"},"metadata":null,"totalPages":114},"loc":{"pageNumber":100}}}],["842523e9-3274-4af6-a646-49d2de9b0c5b",{"pageContent":" 102 \n \nDifferent taxes that we pay \nAs  said earlier  we  pay  different  types  of \ntaxes  to  the  government,  which  can  be \nclassified  as  direct  and  indirect. Direct \ntaxes  are  those  that  are  imposed  and  paid  by  the  tax  payer  directly  to  the  government  (like, \ntaxes  on  income  and  wealth)  Indirect  taxes  are  those  taxes  that  we  pay  indirectly  to  the \ngovernment (like, taxes on commodities). An understanding of these taxes is necessary for us \nto be aware of the payments that we have to make. \nIncome tax  \nWhen  you  start  earning  incomes beyond  the  exemption  limit,  you  will  have  to  pay taxes \nwhich  are progressive,  meaning  that  the  more  you  earn,  the  more  you  pay. Income  tax  is \nlevied  on  the  income  of  individuals  or  on \nthe   profits   earned   by   companies   and \nbusinesses.    Personal    income    tax    and \ncorporate  income  tax  together contribute \ntowards  a  major  share  of  tax  revenue  to \ncentral  government.  The  Income  Tax Act \nwas incorporated in India  in1860. Income \ntaxes  are  imposed  by  the Government  of \nIndia    on    taxable    income    of    Hindu \nUndivided  Families  (HUFs),  companies,  individuals, firms,  co-operative  societies  and  trusts \n(which are identified as a body of individuals and association of persons). Even the gifts that \nyou receive from persons other than relatives come under the purview of income tax and are \nincluded in your income.  \nCorporate Tax \nWhen a  company earns profit,  corporate  tax  has to  be  paid. Corporate tax  is  the  tax  charged \non  the  profits  earned  by  associations  and  companies  by  several  jurisdictions.  The  excess  of \nearnings that a  company makes over the expenses incurred (cost of production) will be  your \nprofit. On this profit, the company has to pay corporate tax according to rules.

The rate of corporate tax in India depends on whether the profits have been \npassed on to the shareholders or not. \nCapital Gains Tax \nDid you know that you will have to pay taxes on all your capital gains that you receive upon \nthe  sale  of  assets?  A capital gain  is  any  income  generated  by  selling  a  capital  investment \n(business  stocks,  paintings,  houses,  family  business,  farmhouse,  etc.).  The  'gain'  here  is  the \ndifference  between  the  price  originally  paid  for  the  investment  and  money  received  upon \nselling it, and is taxable.  \nWealth Tax \nThe wealth that you possess also entails you to contribute towards the tax exchequer. Wealth \ntax  is  levied  on  the  property  owned  depending  on  the  market  value  of  it.  If  you  possess  net \nwealth over a certain exemption limit (now `. 30 lakh) other than ownership of one residential \nproperty it is mandatory to pay wealth tax and file a return to avoid tax collector knocking at \nyour door.  \nExcise Duty \nYou pay taxes to the government while purchasing commodities. One among the indirect tax \nis  the  excise duty which  is one  of  the most  well  known  forms  of  taxation  in  India. Excise \nduties  are  imposed  on  goods  at  the  time  of  production.  It  is  paid  to  the  government  by  the \nfactory  itself,  but  in  reality  the  burden  of  the  tax  falls  on  those  who  buy  the  goods.  The \nproducer  increases  the  prices  of  goods  they  sell  to  cover  the  amount  that  they  have  paid  in \nform of excise duties. The rates of excise duties vary depending on the nature of commodity. \nExcise tax  also  serves  various  purposes  of  price  control,  adequate  supply  of  essential \ncommodities, promotion of small-scale industries and industrial growth. \nCustoms Duty \nDuring your visits to the market you might have come across foreign brand products varying \nfrom toys, chocolates to stationary and consumable items and probably wanted to purchase it \nbut felt hesitant seeing the price tag.

The Central Board of \nExcise and Customs under the Ministry of Finance manages the customs duty process in the \ncountry.  \nTypes of state taxes  \nApart  from  the  central  taxes, we  also  pay  certain  taxes  on  various  goods and  services  to  the \nstate government. Let us see which these taxes are:  \nSales Tax/VAT \nProbably  this  is  one  of  the  taxes  that  you  have  been  paying  indirectly  to  the  government. \nWhen  you  purchase  commodities  or  when  you  eat  at a restaurant  your  bills  are  inclusive  of \nthe  sales/VAT  taxes. The  state  governments  in  India  impose  sales  tax which  is  paid  by  the \ndealer or shopkeeper and this amount is later added to the price of the good.  The taxes range \nin percentages according to the type of goods. Essential commodities such as food, room and \nboard are not taxed. Petroleum, tobacco  and liquor are taxed, but the percentage varies from \nregion to region, as the state governments have regulatory control.  In most cases, sales taxes \nare  charged  on  the  sale  of  movable  goods.  The  sales  taxes  have  been  replaced  with  Value \nAdded  Tax  (VAT). This  is  the  tax  that  a  manufacturer  needs  to  pay  while  purchasing  raw \nmaterials  and  a  trader  needs  to  pay  while  purchasing  goods.  VAT  is  eventually  expected  to \nreplace sales tax.  All  goods  and  services  provided  by  business  individuals  and  companies \ncome  under  the  ambit  of  VAT. The  VAT  rates  of  petroleum, tobacco,  liquor  and so  on  are \nhigher and differ from state to state.  \nGoods and Service Tax (GST) \n Proposals are  being  carried  out  to  combine  tax  on  goods  as  well  as  services  such  as  VAT, \nexcise duties, service tax and replace them with a single GST.
